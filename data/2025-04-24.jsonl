Finally, in participatory\nbudgeting, a local community may need to select a subset of public projects to\nfund. Regardless of context, agents must estimate the uncertain values of a\npotentially large number of projects. Developing parsimonious methods to\ncompare these projects, and aggregating agent evaluations so that the overall\nbenefit is maximized, are critical in assembling the best project portfolio.\nUnlike in standard sorting algorithms, evaluating projects on the basis of\nuncertain long-term benefits introduces additional complexities.

However, Sinkhorn's\nalgorithm is iterative, approximative, non-parametric and thus inflexible\nw.r.t. the obtained doubly stochastic matrix (DSM). Recently, it has been\nproven that DSMs can be obtained with a parametric quantum circuit, yielding a\nnovel quantum inductive bias for DSMs with no known classical analogue.\nMotivated by this, we demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid classical-quantum\ndoubly stochastic Transformer (QDSFormer) that replaces the Softmax in the\nself-attention layer with a variational quantum circuit.

We model it by a Markov Decision\nProcess with time-varying rewards and transition probabilities, with a\nvariation budget of $\\Delta_T$. Existing non-stationary RL algorithms focus on\nmodel-based and model-free value-based methods. Policy-based methods despite\ntheir flexibility in practice are not theoretically well understood in\nnon-stationary RL. We propose and analyze the first model-free policy-based\nalgorithm, Non-Stationary Natural Actor-Critic (NS-NAC), a policy gradient\nmethod with a restart based exploration for change and a novel interpretation\nof learning rates as adapting factors. Further, we present a bandit-over-RL\nbased parameter-free algorithm BORL-NS-NAC that does not require prior\nknowledge of the variation budget $\\Delta_T$. We present a dynamic regret of\n$\\tilde{\\mathscr O}(|S|^{1/2}|A|^{1/2}\\Delta_T^{1/6}T^{5/6})$ for both\nalgorithms, where $T$ is the time horizon, and $|S|$, $|A|$ are the sizes of\nthe state and action spaces.

In this work, we present Target Concrete Score Matching (TCSM),\na novel and versatile objective for training and fine-tuning discrete diffusion\nmodels. TCSM provides a general framework with broad applicability. It supports\npre-training discrete diffusion models directly from data samples, and many\nexisting discrete diffusion approaches naturally emerge as special cases of our\nmore general TCSM framework. Furthermore, the same TCSM objective extends to\npost-training of discrete diffusion models, including fine-tuning using reward\nfunctions or preference data, and distillation of knowledge from pre-trained\nautoregressive models. These new capabilities stem from the core idea of TCSM,\nestimating the concrete score of the target distribution, which resides in the\noriginal (clean) data space. This allows seamless integration with reward\nfunctions and pre-trained models, which inherently only operate in the clean\ndata space rather than the noisy intermediate spaces of diffusion processes.\nOur experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that TCSM matches or\nsurpasses current methods.

NA-PINN addresses the issue of\nspatial governing equation variation by assigning an individual network to each\nnodalization of the system code, such that spatial information is excluded from\nboth the input and output domains, and each subnetwork learns to approximate a\npurely temporal solution.

We analyze this differential equation to compute an ``effective Gram\nmatrix'' that characterizes the generalization gap after training in terms of\nthe alignment between this Gram matrix and a certain initial ``residual''.\nEmpirical evaluations on image classification datasets indicate that this\nanalysis can predict the test loss accurately. Further, at any point during\ntraining, the residual predominantly lies in the subspace of the effective Gram\nmatrix with the smallest eigenvalues. This indicates that the training process\nis benign, i.e., it does not lead to significant deterioration of the\ngeneralization gap (which is zero at initialization).

Property-preserving hashing (PPH)\nis a recent construct in cryptography, which preserves some property\n(predicate) of its inputs in the hash domain. Researchers have so far shown\nconstructions of PPH for Hamming distance predicates, which, for instance,\noutputs 1 if two inputs are within Hamming distance $t$. A key feature of PPH\nis its strong correctness guarantee, i.e., the probability that the predicate\nwill not be correctly evaluated in the hash domain is negligible.

Addressing this challenge requires methods that\nsystematically explore skill combinations to uncover task-solving sequences,\nharness generic, easy-to-learn skills (e.g., pushing, grasping) to generalize\nacross unseen tasks, and bypass reliance on symbolic world representations that\ndemand extensive domain and task-specific knowledge. Despite significant\nprogress, these elements remain largely disjoint in existing approaches,\nleaving a critical gap in achieving robust, scalable solutions for complex,\nlong-horizon problems. In this work, we present MOSAIC, a skill-centric\nframework that unifies these elements by using the skills themselves to guide\nthe planning process. MOSAIC uses two families of skills: Generators compute\nexecutable trajectories and world configurations, and Connectors link these\nindependently generated skill trajectories by solving boundary value problems,\nenabling progress toward completing the overall task. By breaking away from the\nconventional paradigm of incrementally discovering skills from predefined start\nor goal states--a limitation that significantly restricts exploration--MOSAIC\nfocuses planning efforts on regions where skills are inherently effective. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of MOSAIC in both simulated and real-world robotic\nmanipulation tasks, showcasing its ability to solve complex long-horizon\nplanning problems using a diverse set of skills incorporating generative\ndiffusion models, motion planning algorithms, and manipulation-specific models.\nVisit https://skill-mosaic.github.io for demonstrations and examples."}

In the training phase,\nwe add an inter-class cosine similarity loss term to penalize excessively\nsimilar token representations, thereby improving the token classification\naccuracy. During the compression phase, we introduce outlier scores to preserve\nrare but critical tokens that are prone to be discarded in task-agnostic\ncompression. These scores are integrated with the classifier's output, making\nthe compressor more generalizable to various tasks. Superior performance is\nachieved at various compression ratios on long-context understanding and\nreasoning benchmarks. Moreover, our method obtains a speedup of 3.3x at a 4x\ncompression ratio on a resource-constrained mobile device."}

For instance, if a jobs program benefits members\nof one city more than another, is that due to differences in program\nparticipants (particular covariates) or the local labor markets (outcomes given\ncovariates)? The Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder (KOB) decomposition is a standard tool\nin econometrics that explains the difference in the mean outcome across two\npopulations. However, the KOB decomposition assumes a linear relationship\nbetween covariates and outcomes, while the true relationship may be\nmeaningfully nonlinear. Modern machine learning boasts a variety of nonlinear\nfunctional decompositions for the relationship between outcomes and covariates\nin one population. It seems natural to extend the KOB decomposition using these\nfunctional decompositions. We observe that a successful extension should not\nattribute the differences to covariates -- or, respectively, to outcomes given\ncovariates -- if those are the same in the two populations. Unfortunately, we\ndemonstrate that, even in simple examples, two common decompositions --\nfunctional ANOVA and Accumulated Local Effects -- can attribute differences to\noutcomes given covariates, even when they are identical in two populations. We\nprovide a characterization of when functional ANOVA misattributes, as well as a\ngeneral property that any discrete decomposition must satisfy to avoid\nmisattribution. We show that if the decomposition is independent of its input\ndistribution, it does not misattribute. We further conjecture that\nmisattribution arises in any reasonable additive decomposition that depends on\nthe distribution of the covariates."}

Proceedings of the\n  Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)", "summary": "As the field of representation learning grows, there has been a proliferation\nof different loss functions to solve different classes of problems. We\nintroduce a single information-theoretic equation that generalizes a large\ncollection of modern loss functions in machine learning. In particular, we\nintroduce a framework that shows that several broad classes of machine learning\nmethods are precisely minimizing an integrated KL divergence between two\nconditional distributions: the supervisory and learned representations. This\nviewpoint exposes a hidden information geometry underlying clustering, spectral\nmethods, dimensionality reduction, contrastive learning, and supervised\nlearning. This framework enables the development of new loss functions by\ncombining successful techniques from across the literature. We not only present\na wide array of proofs, connecting over 23 different approaches, but we also\nleverage these theoretical results to create state-of-the-art unsupervised\nimage classifiers that achieve a +8% improvement over the prior\nstate-of-the-art on unsupervised classification on ImageNet-1K. We also\ndemonstrate that I-Con can be used to derive principled debiasing methods which\nimprove contrastive representation learners."}
