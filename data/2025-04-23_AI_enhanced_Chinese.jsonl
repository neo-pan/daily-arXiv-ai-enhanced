The control strategy is based on minimizing a quadratic cost function\nthat penalizes deviations of system states and control inputs from their\ndesired trajectories.\n  For linear systems, the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) solution\nis derived using dynamic programming, resulting in recursive equations for\nfeedback and feedforward terms. For nonlinear dynamics, the Iterative Linear\nQuadratic Regulator (iLQR) method is employed, which iteratively linearizes the\nsystem and solves a sequence of LQR problems to converge to an optimal policy.\n  To implement this approach, a software service was developed and tested on\nseveral canonical models, including: Rayleigh oscillator, inverted pendulum on\na moving cart, two-link manipulator, and quadcopter. The results confirm that\niLQR enables efficient and accurate trajectory tracking in the presence of\nnonlinearities.\n  To further enhance performance, it can be seamlessly integrated with Model\nPredictive Control (MPC), enabling online adaptation and improved robustness to\nconstraints and system uncertainties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e8c\u6b21\u4ee3\u4ef7\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528LQR\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528iLQR\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217LQR\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u670d\u52a1\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aiLQR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4e0eMPC\u6574\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0eMPC\u65e0\u7f1d\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

These ML agents are typically\ndesigned to balance multiple objectives when making choices. Understanding how\ntheir decision-making processes align with or diverge from human reasoning is\nessential. Human agents often encounter hard choices, that is, situations where\noptions are incommensurable; neither option is preferred, yet the agent is not\nindifferent between them. In such cases, human agents can identify hard choices\nand resolve them through deliberation. In contrast, current ML agents, due to\nfundamental limitations in Multi-Objective Optimisation or MOO methods, cannot\nidentify hard choices, let alone resolve them. Neither Scalarised Optimisation\nnor Pareto Optimisation, the two principal MOO approaches, can capture\nincommensurability. This limitation generates three distinct alignment\nproblems: the alienness of ML decision-making behaviour from a human\nperspective; the unreliability of preference-based alignment strategies for\nhard choices; and the blockage of alignment strategies pursuing multiple\nobjectives. Evaluating two potential technical solutions, I recommend an\nensemble solution that appears most promising for enabling ML agents to\nidentify hard choices and mitigate alignment problems. However, no known\ntechnique allows ML agents to resolve hard choices through deliberation, as\nthey cannot autonomously change their goals.

Early prediction of\nBW enables timely interventions; however, current methods like ultrasonography\nhave limitations, including reduced accuracy before 20 weeks and operator\ndependent variability. Existing models often neglect nutritional and genetic\ninfluences, focusing mainly on physiological and lifestyle factors. This study\npresents an attention-based transformer model with a multi-encoder architecture\nfor early (less than 12 weeks of gestation) BW prediction. Our model\neffectively integrates diverse maternal data such as physiological, lifestyle,\nnutritional, and genetic, addressing limitations seen in prior attention-based\nmodels such as TabNet. The model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 122\ngrams and an R-squared value of 0.94, demonstrating high predictive accuracy\nand interoperability with our in-house private dataset. Independent validation\nconfirms generalizability (MAE: 105 grams, R-squared: 0.95) with the IEEE\nchildren dataset. To enhance clinical utility, predicted BW is classified into\nlow and normal categories, achieving a sensitivity of 97.55% and a specificity\nof 94.48%, facilitating early risk stratification. Model interpretability is\nreinforced through feature importance and SHAP analyses, highlighting\nsignificant influences of maternal age, tobacco exposure, and vitamin B12\nstatus, with genetic factors playing a secondary role.

In experiments on cross-domain few-shot classification using the\nMeta-Dataset and CDFSL benchmarks, our method significantly improves\nout-of-domain performance over the non-fine-tuned baseline while incurring only\n6\\% of the memory cost and 0.02\\% of the computation time of standard\nfine-tuning, thus establishing a practical middle ground between direct\ntransfer and fully fine-tuned approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u65e0\u9700\u8ba1\u7b97\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6216\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3aODE\u7684Euler\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\uff08\u5982Euler\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u6216\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728Meta-Dataset\u548cCDFSL\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u57df\u5916\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u76846%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u4e3a0.02%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To tackle these challenges,\nresearchers have proposed techniques like client sampling and update\ncompression.

Although extensive research has addressed issues such\nas factuality, bias, and toxicity, comparatively little attention has been paid\nto measuring alignment to preferences, i.e., the relative desirability of\ndifferent alternatives, a concept used in decision making, economics, and\nsocial choice theory.

In practice, user\nfeedback on such lists typically involves identifying a few relevant items in\ncontext rather than providing detailed pairwise comparisons for every possible\nitem pair. Moreover, many complex information retrieval tasks, such as\nconversational agents and summarization systems, critically depend on ranking\nthe highest-quality outputs at the top, emphasizing the need to support natural\nand flexible forms of user feedback. To address the challenge of limited and\nsparse pairwise feedback in the in-context setting, we propose an In-context\nRanking Preference Optimization (IRPO) framework that directly optimizes LLMs\nbased on ranking lists constructed during inference. To further capture\nflexible forms of feedback, IRPO extends the DPO objective by incorporating\nboth the relevance of items and their positions in the list. Modeling these\naspects jointly is non-trivial, as ranking metrics are inherently discrete and\nnon-differentiable, making direct optimization difficult. To overcome this,\nIRPO introduces a differentiable objective based on positional aggregation of\npairwise item preferences, enabling effective gradient-based optimization of\ndiscrete ranking metrics. We further provide theoretical insights showing that\nIRPO (i) automatically emphasizes items with greater disagreement between the\nmodel and the reference ranking, and (ii) links its gradient to an importance\nsampling estimator, yielding an unbiased estimator with reduced variance.\nEmpirical results show IRPO outperforms standard DPO approaches in ranking\nperformance, highlighting its effectiveness in aligning LLMs with direct\nin-context ranking preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faIRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316LLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6392\u540d\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6DPO\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u901a\u5e38\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u975e\u6210\u5bf9\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u8981\u826f\u597d\u6392\u540d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIRPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u805a\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6392\u540d\u5217\u8868\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aIRPO\u5728\u6392\u540d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eDPO\u3002", "conclusion": "IRPO\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6392\u540d\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002"}}

A barrier certificate for a stochastic dynamical\nsystem acts as a nonnegative supermartingale, and provides a lower bound on the\nprobability that the system is safe. The promise of such certificates is that\ntheir search can be effectively automated. Typically, one may use optimization\nor SMT solvers to find such barrier certificates of a given fixed template.\nWhen such approaches fail, a typical approach is to instead change the\ntemplate. We propose an alternative approach that we dub interpolation-inspired\nbarrier certificates. An interpolation-inspired barrier certificate consists of\na set of functions that jointly provide a lower bound on the probability of\nsatisfying safety. We show how one may find such certificates of a fixed\ntemplate, even when we fail to find standard barrier certificates of the same\ntemplate. However, we note that such certificates still need to ensure a\nsupermartingale guarantee for one function in the set. To address this\nchallenge, we consider the use of $k$-induction with these\ninterpolation-inspired certificates. The recent use of $k$-induction in barrier\ncertificates allows one to relax the supermartingale requirement at every time\nstep to a combination of a supermartingale requirement every $k$ steps and a\n$c$-martingale requirement for the intermediate steps. We provide a generic\nformulation of a barrier certificate that we dub $k$-inductive\ninterpolation-inspired barrier certificate. The formulation allows for several\ncombinations of interpolation and $k$-induction for barrier certificate. We\npresent two examples among the possible combinations.

Therefore, MRTA solutions should be tested with the navigation stacks\nof the robots in mind, taking into account robot planning, conflict avoidance\nbetween robots, and human interaction and avoidance. This tool connects the\nallocation output of MRTA solvers to individual robot planning using the NAV2\nstack and local, centralized multi-robot deconfliction using Control Barrier\nFunction-Quadrtic Programs (CBF-QPs), creating a platform closer to real-world\noperation for more comprehensive testing of these approaches.
