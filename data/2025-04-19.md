### [1] [Interpretable AI-driven Guidelines for Type 2 Diabetes Treatment from Observational Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12417)
*Dewang Kumar Agarwal,Dimitris J. Bertsimas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究使用AI开发了一种针对2型糖尿病的治疗进展指南，通过机器学习优化数据，并在测试中显示出比医生更好的HbA1c降低效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建精确、结构化、数据支持的2型糖尿病治疗进展指南，适合临床采用。

Method: 使用机器学习和优化去除混杂偏差，训练树模型开具治疗方案，并在BMC和Hartford数据集上测试。

Result: 在BMC未见数据上，HbA1c降低中位数比医生多0.26%；在Hartford队列上多0.13%。

Conclusion: 这种AI支持的方法精确、可解释、高效，预计能优于当前实践，并可部署以改善患者结果。

Abstract: Objective: Create precise, structured, data-backed guidelines for type 2
diabetes treatment progression, suitable for clinical adoption.
  Research Design and Methods: Our training cohort was composed of patient
(with type 2 diabetes) visits from Boston Medical Center (BMC) from 1998 to
2014. We divide visits into 4 groups based on the patient's treatment regimen
before the visit, and further divide them into subgroups based on the
recommended treatment during the visit. Since each subgroup has observational
data, which has confounding bias (sicker patients are prescribed more
aggressive treatments), we used machine learning and optimization to remove
some datapoints so that the remaining data resembles a randomized trial. On
each subgroup, we train AI-backed tree-based models to prescribe treatment
changes. Once we train these tree models, we manually combine the models for
every group to create an end-to-end prescription pipeline for all patients in
that group. In this process, we prioritize stepping up to a more aggressive
treatment before considering less aggressive options. We tested this pipeline
on unseen data from BMC, and an external dataset from Hartford healthcare (type
2 diabetes patient visits from January 2020 to May 2024).
  Results: The median HbA1c reduction achieved by our pipelines is 0.26% more
than what the doctors achieved on the unseen BMC patients. For the Hartford
cohort, our pipelines were better by 0.13%.
  Conclusions: This precise, interpretable, and efficient AI-backed approach to
treatment progression in type 2 diabetes is predicted to outperform the current
practice and can be deployed to improve patient outcomes.

### [2] [Towards Conversational AI for Human-Machine Collaborative MLOps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12477)
*George Fatouros,Georgios Makridis,George Kousiouris,John Soldatos,Anargyros Tsadimas,Dimosthenis Kyriazis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的对话代理系统Swarm Agent，用于提升MLOps中人机协作，通过自然语言交互简化ML工具使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂MLOps平台如Kubeflow的可访问性问题，使不同技术水平的用户能更易使用高级ML工具。

Method: 采用分层模块化架构，集成KFP Agent、MinIO Agent和RAG Agent，通过迭代推理循环和上下文感知处理实现自然语言交互。

Result: 用户可通过对话接口发现、执行和监控ML管道，管理数据和工件，访问文档，从而降低操作复杂性。

Conclusion: 该系统提高了ML工具的可访问性，并展示了其在减少复杂性和扩展性方面的优势。

Abstract: This paper presents a Large Language Model (LLM) based conversational agent
system designed to enhance human-machine collaboration in Machine Learning
Operations (MLOps). We introduce the Swarm Agent, an extensible architecture
that integrates specialized agents to create and manage ML workflows through
natural language interactions. The system leverages a hierarchical, modular
design incorporating a KubeFlow Pipelines (KFP) Agent for ML pipeline
orchestration, a MinIO Agent for data management, and a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) Agent for domain-specific knowledge integration. Through
iterative reasoning loops and context-aware processing, the system enables
users with varying technical backgrounds to discover, execute, and monitor ML
pipelines; manage datasets and artifacts; and access relevant documentation,
all via intuitive conversational interfaces. Our approach addresses the
accessibility gap in complex MLOps platforms like Kubeflow, making advanced ML
tools broadly accessible while maintaining the flexibility to extend to other
platforms. The paper describes the architecture, implementation details, and
demonstrates how this conversational MLOps assistant reduces complexity and
lowers barriers to entry for users across diverse technical skill levels.

*Luciano Floridi,Carlotta Buttaboni,Emmie Hine,Jessica Morley,Claudio Novelli,Tyler Schroder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了Agentic AI Optimisation (AAIO)，旨在优化网站与自主AI代理的交互，强调其重要性并讨论治理、伦理和监管问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI系统的兴起需要新的优化范式，以确保代理与平台的无缝交互，类似于SEO对内容发现的影响。

Method: 文章通过引入AAIO，分析网站优化与AI成功之间的相互依赖，并探讨治理、伦理、法律和社会影响（GELSI）。

Result: 突出了AAIO创建的良性循环，并强调主动监管框架的必要性，以减轻潜在负面影响。

Conclusion: AAIO是自主数字代理时代数字基础设施的关键组成部分，主张公平和包容性的访问。

Abstract: The emergence of Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AAI) systems capable of
independently initiating digital interactions necessitates a new optimisation
paradigm designed explicitly for seamless agent-platform interactions. This
article introduces Agentic AI Optimisation (AAIO) as an essential methodology
for ensuring effective integration between websites and agentic AI systems.
Like how Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) has shaped digital content
discoverability, AAIO can define interactions between autonomous AI agents and
online platforms. By examining the mutual interdependency between website
optimisation and agentic AI success, the article highlights the virtuous cycle
that AAIO can create. It further explores the governance, ethical, legal, and
social implications (GELSI) of AAIO, emphasising the necessity of proactive
regulatory frameworks to mitigate potential negative impacts. The article
concludes by affirming AAIO's essential role as part of a fundamental digital
infrastructure in the era of autonomous digital agents, advocating for
equitable and inclusive access to its benefits.

### [4] [Heuristic Recognition and Rapid Response to Unfamiliar Events Outside of Agent Design Scope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12497)
*Robert E. Wray,Steven J. Jones,John E. Laird*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨AI代理如何应对开放世界中超出设计范围的未知情况，提出结合人类认知启发和元推理的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文的动机是代理在开放世界中会遇到先前经验之外的情况，缺乏知识或时间做出合理响应。

Method: 方法是结合领域通用元知识（受人类认知评估启发）和元推理，以快速识别和适应未知情况。

Result: 结果是这种方法有潜力提供快速、适应的响应，提升开放世界代理的性能。

Conclusion: 结论是这种方法能更全面地满足开放世界通用代理的需求。

Abstract: Regardless of past learning, an agent in an open world will face unfamiliar
situations and events outside of prior experience, existing models, or
policies. Further, the agent will sometimes lack relevant knowledge and/or
sufficient time to assess the situation, generate and evaluate options, and
pursue a robustly considered course of action. How can an agent respond
reasonably to situations that are outside of its original design scope? How can
it recognize such situations sufficiently quickly and reliably to determine
reasonable, adaptive courses of action? We identify key characteristics needed
for solutions, evaluate the state-of-the-art by these requirements, and outline
a proposed, novel approach that combines domain-general meta-knowledge (in the
form of appraisals inspired by human cognition) and metareasoning. It has the
potential to provide fast, adaptive responses to unfamiliar situations, more
fully meeting the performance characteristics required for open-world, general
agents.

### [5] [Is Trust Correlated With Explainability in AI? A Meta-Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12529)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R. Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这项研究通过元分析方法审视了AI可解释性是否必然提升用户信任，发现中等正相关，但强调可解释性并非唯一因素，并讨论了其在医疗和司法领域的社会技术影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战AI系统中可解释性必然提升用户信任的普遍假设。

Method: 使用元分析方法，对90项现有文献进行全面审查。

Result: 发现AI可解释性和用户信任之间存在统计上显著但中度的正相关关系。

Conclusion: 强调培养AI系统的真实和持久可信性的重要性，并处理算法偏差和伦理透明度等问题。

Abstract: This study critically examines the commonly held assumption that
explicability in artificial intelligence (AI) systems inherently boosts user
trust. Utilizing a meta-analytical approach, we conducted a comprehensive
examination of the existing literature to explore the relationship between AI
explainability and trust. Our analysis, incorporating data from 90 studies,
reveals a statistically significant but moderate positive correlation between
the explainability of AI systems and the trust they engender among users. This
indicates that while explainability contributes to building trust, it is not
the sole or predominant factor in this equation. In addition to academic
contributions to the field of Explainable AI (XAI), this research highlights
its broader socio-technical implications, particularly in promoting
accountability and fostering user trust in critical domains such as healthcare
and justice. By addressing challenges like algorithmic bias and ethical
transparency, the study underscores the need for equitable and sustainable AI
adoption. Rather than focusing solely on immediate trust, we emphasize the
normative importance of fostering authentic and enduring trustworthiness in AI
systems.

### [6] [ZeroSumEval: Scaling LLM Evaluation with Inter-Model Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12562)
*Haidar Khan,Hisham A. Alyahya,Yazeed Alnumay,M Saiful Bari,Bülent Yener*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ZeroSumEval 是一种新型基于零和游戏的竞争评估协议，用于动态评估大语言模型（LLMs），以解决传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 LLM 评估方法存在过拟合、高成本和偏差问题，因此开发 ZeroSumEval 来提供更动态、抗饱和的基准。

Method: 构建了 ZeroSumEval 框架，包括多种游戏（如 PyJail、Chess 等），并进行了超过 7000 次模拟实验，涉及 13 个模型。

Result: 结果显示，GPT 和 Claude 系列模型在常见游戏中表现良好，但难以创建新颖问题，且在越狱和创造力任务上失败。

Conclusion: ZeroSumEval 提供了一个标准化、可扩展的 LLM 评估框架，并开源代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has traditionally
relied on static benchmark datasets, human assessments, or model-based
evaluations - methods that often suffer from overfitting, high costs, and
biases. ZeroSumEval is a novel competition-based evaluation protocol that
leverages zero-sum games to assess LLMs with dynamic benchmarks that resist
saturation. ZeroSumEval encompasses a diverse suite of games, including
security challenges (PyJail), classic games (Chess, Liar's Dice, Poker),
knowledge tests (MathQuiz), and persuasion challenges (Gandalf, Debate). These
games are designed to evaluate a range of AI capabilities such as strategic
reasoning, planning, knowledge application, and creativity. Building upon
recent studies that highlight the effectiveness of game-based evaluations for
LLMs, ZeroSumEval enhances these approaches by providing a standardized and
extensible framework. To demonstrate this, we conduct extensive experiments
with >7000 simulations across 7 games and 13 models. Our results show that
while frontier models from the GPT and Claude families can play common games
and answer questions, they struggle to play games that require creating novel
and challenging questions. We also observe that models cannot reliably
jailbreak each other and fail generally at tasks requiring creativity. We
release our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/ZeroSumEval.

### [7] [The Chronicles of Foundation AI for Forensics of Multi-Agent Provenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12612)
*Ching-Chun Chang,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用符号编年史从内容中事后追踪多代理生成历史的系统，以实现AI协作的可问责性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多代理AI系统中，内容不断被修改，难以追踪贡献来源，亟需方法来揭示生成历史以支持透明性。

Method: 通过反馈循环，每个生成步骤更新带时间戳的符号编年史，并与合成内容同步，无需依赖内部记忆或外部元信息。

Result: 开发了一种类似法医链 custody 的系统，能够从内容本身重建生成历史。

Conclusion: 这项研究推动了在演进网络生态中实现可问责协作AI的发展。

Abstract: Provenance is the chronology of things, resonating with the fundamental
pursuit to uncover origins, trace connections, and situate entities within the
flow of space and time. As artificial intelligence advances towards autonomous
agents capable of interactive collaboration on complex tasks, the provenance of
generated content becomes entangled in the interplay of collective creation,
where contributions are continuously revised, extended or overwritten. In a
multi-agent generative chain, content undergoes successive transformations,
often leaving little, if any, trace of prior contributions. In this study, we
investigates the problem of tracking multi-agent provenance across the temporal
dimension of generation. We propose a chronological system for post hoc
attribution of generative history from content alone, without reliance on
internal memory states or external meta-information. At its core lies the
notion of symbolic chronicles, representing signed and time-stamped records, in
a form analogous to the chain of custody in forensic science. The system
operates through a feedback loop, whereby each generative timestep updates the
chronicle of prior interactions and synchronises it with the synthetic content
in the very act of generation. This research seeks to develop an accountable
form of collaborative artificial intelligence within evolving cyber ecosystems.

### [8] [Embodied-R: Collaborative Framework for Activating Embodied Spatial Reasoning in Foundation Models via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12680)
*Baining Zhao,Ziyou Wang,Jianjie Fang,Chen Gao,Fanhang Man,Jinqiang Cui,Xin Wang,Xinlei Chen,Yong Li,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Embodied-R, a framework combining VLMs and LMs with RL for efficient spatial reasoning, achieving SOTA performance with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how pretrained models acquire spatial reasoning abilities and develop a resource-efficient method for high-level reasoning from visual observations.

Method: Embodied-R uses large-scale VLMs for perception and small-scale LMs for reasoning, trained with RL and a reward system focused on logical consistency.

Result: After training on 5k samples, it matches SOTA models like OpenAI-o1 and Gemini-2.5-pro on spatial reasoning tasks and exhibits emergent thinking patterns.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective slow-thinking capabilities with limited resources and provides insights into training strategies and model generalization.

Abstract: Humans can perceive and reason about spatial relationships from sequential
visual observations, such as egocentric video streams. However, how pretrained
models acquire such abilities, especially high-level reasoning, remains
unclear. This paper introduces Embodied-R, a collaborative framework combining
large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for perception and small-scale
Language Models (LMs) for reasoning. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
novel reward system considering think-answer logical consistency, the model
achieves slow-thinking capabilities with limited computational resources. After
training on only 5k embodied video samples, Embodied-R with a 3B LM matches
state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning models (OpenAI-o1, Gemini-2.5-pro) on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution embodied spatial reasoning tasks.
Embodied-R also exhibits emergent thinking patterns such as systematic analysis
and contextual integration. We further explore research questions including
response length, training on VLM, strategies for reward design, and differences
in model generalization after SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and RL training.

### [9] [WebLists: Extracting Structured Information From Complex Interactive Websites Using Executable LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12682)
*Arth Bohra,Manvel Saroyan,Danil Melkozerov,Vahe Karufanyan,Gabriel Maher,Pascal Weinberger,Artem Harutyunyan,Giovanni Campagna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本论文提出WebLists基准测试和BardeenAgent框架，用于改进网页数据提取任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络代理研究主要关注导航和交易任务，忽略了大规模结构化数据提取的需求。

Method: 提出BardeenAgent框架，将代理执行转换为可重复程序，利用HTML结构构建CSS选择器来提取数据。

Result: 在WebLists基准上，BardeenAgent达到66%的召回率，比现有技术翻倍，并降低成本3倍。

Conclusion: BardeenAgent显著提升了数据提取任务的效率和效果。

Abstract: Most recent web agent research has focused on navigation and transaction
tasks, with little emphasis on extracting structured data at scale. We present
WebLists, a benchmark of 200 data-extraction tasks across four common business
and enterprise use-cases. Each task requires an agent to navigate to a webpage,
configure it appropriately, and extract complete datasets with well-defined
schemas. We show that both LLMs with search capabilities and SOTA web agents
struggle with these tasks, with a recall of 3% and 31%, respectively, despite
higher performance on question-answering tasks.
  To address this challenge, we propose BardeenAgent, a novel framework that
enables web agents to convert their execution into repeatable programs, and
replay them at scale across pages with similar structure. BardeenAgent is also
the first LLM agent to take advantage of the regular structure of HTML. In
particular BardeenAgent constructs a generalizable CSS selector to capture all
relevant items on the page, then fits the operations to extract the data.
  On the WebLists benchmark, BardeenAgent achieves 66% recall overall, more
than doubling the performance of SOTA web agents, and reducing cost per output
row by 3x.

### [10] [InstructRAG: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Instruction Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13032)
*Zheng Wang,Shu Xian Teo,Jun Jie Chew,Wei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出InstructRAG方法，通过检索增强生成和多代理元强化学习框架，提高大型语言模型的任务规划性能，在实验中比现有方法改善高达19.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖TAO过程，但LLM对复杂任务知识有限；本文识别出应用RAG到任务规划的两个关键挑战：enlargability和transferability。

Method: 提出InstructRAG，包括一个图组织过去的指令路径、RL-Agent使用强化学习扩展图覆盖以提高enlargability、ML-Agent使用元学习提高任务泛化以改善transferability，二者端到端训练。

Result: 在四个常用任务规划数据集上的实验中，InstructRAG显著提升性能，并高效适应新任务，最高改善19.2%。

Conclusion: InstructRAG有效解决了挑战，提高了规划性能和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use as
agents for planning complex tasks. Existing methods typically rely on a
thought-action-observation (TAO) process to enhance LLM performance, but these
approaches are often constrained by the LLMs' limited knowledge of complex
tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers new opportunities by
leveraging external databases to ground generation in retrieved information. In
this paper, we identify two key challenges (enlargability and transferability)
in applying RAG to task planning. We propose InstructRAG, a novel solution
within a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning framework, to address these
challenges. InstructRAG includes a graph to organize past instruction paths
(sequences of correct actions), an RL-Agent with Reinforcement Learning to
expand graph coverage for enlargability, and an ML-Agent with Meta-Learning to
improve task generalization for transferability. The two agents are trained
end-to-end to optimize overall planning performance. Our experiments on four
widely used task planning datasets demonstrate that InstructRAG significantly
enhances performance and adapts efficiently to new tasks, achieving up to a
19.2% improvement over the best existing approach.

### [11] [Exploring Expert Failures Improves LLM Agent Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13145)
*Li-Cheng Lan,Andrew Bai,Minhao Cheng,Ruochen Wang,Cho-Jui Hsieh,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出EEF方法，利用专家失败轨迹中的有益行动改进LLM代理微调，在WebShop中达到62%的胜率，超越RFT和GPT-4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFT更适合简单场景，复杂子任务未解决，专家失败轨迹可提供宝贵指导。

Method: EEF从专家失败轨迹中识别有益行动，融入训练数据集，并排除有害行动。

Result: 在WebShop中胜率62%，优于RFT（53.6%）和GPT-4（35.6%），在WebShop和SciWorld中设定新状态。

Conclusion: EEF通过利用专家失败，成功解决之前无法解决的子任务，并提升代理调优性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential as agents,
excelling at tasks that require multiple rounds of reasoning and interactions.
Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as an effective method for
finetuning LLMs as agents: it first imitates expert-generated successful
trajectories and further improves agentic skills through iterative fine-tuning
on successful, self-generated trajectories. However, since the expert (e.g.,
GPT-4) succeeds primarily on simpler subtasks and RFT inherently favors simpler
scenarios, many complex subtasks remain unsolved and persistently
out-of-distribution (OOD). Upon investigating these challenging subtasks, we
discovered that previously failed expert trajectories can often provide
valuable guidance, e.g., plans and key actions, that can significantly improve
agent exploration efficiency and acquisition of critical skills. Motivated by
these observations, we propose Exploring Expert Failures (EEF), which
identifies beneficial actions from failed expert trajectories and integrates
them into the training dataset. Potentially harmful actions are meticulously
excluded to prevent contamination of the model learning process. By leveraging
the beneficial actions in expert failures, EEF successfully solves some
previously unsolvable subtasks and improves agent tuning performance.
Remarkably, our approach achieved a 62\% win rate in WebShop, outperforming RFT
(53. 6\%) and GPT-4 (35. 6\%), and to the best of our knowledge, setting a new
state-of-the-art as the first method to surpass a score of 0.81 in WebShop and
exceed 81 in SciWorld.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了反蒸馏采样方法，通过修改模型的下一个标记概率分布来毒化推理痕迹，减少蒸馏的有效性，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型所有者希望防止他人通过推理痕迹进行未经授权的模型蒸馏。

Method: 战略性地修改模型的下一个标记概率分布，以毒化推理痕迹。

Result: 使推理痕迹在蒸馏中变得显著不有效，但不影响模型的实际效用。

Conclusion: 反蒸馏采样为模型提供了一种保护机制，限制了蒸馏的可能。

Abstract: Frontier models that generate extended reasoning traces inadvertently produce
rich token sequences that can facilitate model distillation. Recognizing this
vulnerability, model owners may seek sampling strategies that limit the
effectiveness of distillation without compromising model performance.
\emph{Antidistillation sampling} provides exactly this capability. By
strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution,
antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them
significantly less effective for distillation while preserving the model's
practical utility. For further details, see https://antidistillation.com.

Abstract: Creating responsible artificial intelligence (AI) systems is an important
issue in contemporary research and development of works on AI. One of the
characteristics of responsible AI systems is their explainability. In the
paper, we are interested in explainable deep learning (XDL) systems. On the
basis of the creation of digital twins of physical objects, we introduce the
idea of creating readable twins (in the form of imprecise information flow
models) for unreadable deep learning models. The complete procedure for
switching from the deep learning model (DLM) to the imprecise information flow
model (IIFM) is presented. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example
of a deep learning classification model for image recognition of handwritten
digits from the MNIST data set.

*Kevin Lin,Charlie Snell,Yu Wang,Charles Packer,Sarah Wooders,Ion Stoica,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本论文引入睡眠时间计算（sleep-time compute），通过离线预计算用户可能查询的内容，减少大型语言模型（LLMs）的测试时间计算需求，从而降低延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解决LLMs在测试时计算量大导致的高延迟和推理成本问题，特别是针对困难任务。

Method: 方法包括修改推理任务（如Stateful GSM-Symbolic和Stateful AIME），使用睡眠时间计算预先计算有用量，并引入Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic来跨相关查询分摊计算。

Result: 结果显示，睡眠时间计算可将测试时间计算减少约5倍，提高准确性最多13%（Stateful GSM-Symbolic）和18%（Stateful AIME），多查询设置下平均成本每查询减少2.5倍。

Conclusion: 结论是睡眠时间计算在查询可预测性高时效果最佳，并通过软件工程任务案例研究验证其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key ingredient for enabling large
language models (LLMs) to solve difficult problems, but comes with high latency
and inference cost. We introduce sleep-time compute, which allows models to
"think" offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating
what queries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, we can
significantly reduce the compute requirements at test-time. To demonstrate the
efficacy of our method, we create modified versions of two reasoning tasks -
Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. We find that sleep-time compute can
reduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~
5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time
compute we can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic
and 18% on Stateful AIME. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic,
which extends GSM-Symbolic by including multiple related queries per context.
By amortizing sleep-time compute across related queries about the same context
using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, we can decrease the average cost per query by
2.5x. We then conduct additional analysis to understand when sleep-time compute
is most effective, finding the predictability of the user query to be well
correlated with the efficacy of sleep-time compute. Finally, we conduct a
case-study of applying sleep-time compute to a realistic agentic SWE task.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts based large language models (MoE LLMs) have shown
significant promise in multitask adaptability by dynamically routing inputs to
specialized experts. Despite their success, the collaborative mechanisms among
experts are still not well understood, limiting both the interpretability and
optimization of these models. In this paper, we focus on two critical issues:
(1) identifying expert collaboration patterns, and (2) optimizing MoE LLMs
through expert pruning. To address the first issue, we propose a hierarchical
sparse dictionary learning (HSDL) method that uncovers the collaboration
patterns among experts. For the second issue, we introduce the
Contribution-Aware Expert Pruning (CAEP) algorithm, which effectively prunes
low-contribution experts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that expert
collaboration patterns are closely linked to specific input types and exhibit
semantic significance across various tasks. Moreover, pruning experiments show
that our approach improves overall performance by 2.5\% on average,
outperforming existing methods. These findings offer valuable insights into
enhancing the efficiency and interpretability of MoE LLMs, offering a clearer
understanding of expert interactions and improving model optimization.

TL;DR: aLoRA 通过修改 LoRA 框架，实现即时激活特定模型，而无需重新计算 KV 缓存，提高多轮对话效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准 LoRA 在多轮设置中切换时需重新计算整个历史 KV 缓存导致的低效率问题。

Method: 提出 aLoRA，仅为激活后的序列令牌调整权重，并使用基础模型的 KV 缓存。

Result: aLoRA 在准确性上与标准 LoRA 相当，同时显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: aLoRA 启用构建专业化 intrinsics 模型，用于在输入链或对话特定部分执行高效操作。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for
finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to
method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly
customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a
multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the
entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation
can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which
modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the
sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA
to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can
be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the
cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly
specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an
input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We
use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive
accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

Conclusion: 该方法简化了权重选择，并证明了其在找到平衡解决方案方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization involving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problems arises in various domains. A fundamental challenge
in this context is the effective balancing of multiple objectives, each
potentially operating on very different scales. This imbalance introduces
complications such as the selection of appropriate weights when scalarizing
multiple objectives into a single objective function. In this paper, we propose
a novel technique for scaling QUBO objectives that uses an exact computation of
the variance of each individual QUBO objective. By scaling each objective to
have unit variance, we align all objectives onto a common scale, thereby
allowing for more balanced solutions to be found when scalarizing the
objectives with equal weights, as well as potentially assisting in the search
or choice of weights during scalarization. Finally, we demonstrate its
advantages through empirical evaluations on various multi-objective
optimization problems. Our results are noteworthy since manually selecting
scalarization weights is cumbersome, and reliable, efficient solutions are
scarce.

Motivation: 人工智能系统的 opacity 导致信任和接受度的挑战，因此需要结合连接主义和符号主义方法来提升可解释性。

Result: 开发了原型，使用 Keras 和 Java 环境，证明了提取符号表示的可行性，并增强了 AI 系统的信任。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across
industries, driven by advances in deep learning and natural language
processing, and fueled by large-scale data and computing resources. Despite its
rapid adoption, the opacity of AI systems poses significant challenges to trust
and acceptance.
  This work explores the intersection of connectionist and symbolic approaches
to artificial intelligence, focusing on the derivation of interpretable
symbolic models, such as decision trees, from feedforward neural networks
(FNNs). Decision trees provide a transparent framework for elucidating the
operations of neural networks while preserving their functionality. The
derivation is presented in a step-by-step approach and illustrated with several
examples. A systematic methodology is proposed to bridge neural and symbolic
paradigms by exploiting distributed representations in FNNs to identify
symbolic components, including fillers, roles, and their interrelationships.
The process traces neuron activation values and input configurations across
network layers, mapping activations and their underlying inputs to decision
tree edges. The resulting symbolic structures effectively capture FNN decision
processes and enable scalability to deeper networks through iterative
refinement of subpaths for each hidden layer.
  To validate the theoretical framework, a prototype was developed using Keras
.h5-data and emulating TensorFlow within the Java JDK/JavaFX environment. This
prototype demonstrates the feasibility of extracting symbolic representations
from neural networks, enhancing trust in AI systems, and promoting
accountability.

TL;DR: 本研究发现，在机器学习模型中，仅使用位置坐标比使用Moran特征向量更准确，尤其在正空间自相关情况下。

Motivation: 探讨Moran特征向量是否能作为机器学习中的空间特征来处理空间效应。

Method: 生成合成数据集，使用不同空间权重矩阵的Moran特征向量，测试随机森林、LightGBM等模型，并与仅用坐标的模型比较，使用GeoShapley解释。

Result: 使用坐标的模型准确性更高；发现适用于正空间自相关，但不一定适用于负自相关或网络自相关。

Conclusion: Moran特征向量在某些机器学习应用中可能不如预期有效，但在其他情况如负自相关时仍有用处。

Abstract: Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) approaches have shown promise in
accounting for spatial effects in statistical models. Can this extend to
machine learning? This paper examines the effectiveness of using Moran
Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. We
generate synthetic datasets with known processes involving spatially varying
and nonlinear effects across two different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors
calculated from different spatial weights matrices, with and without a priori
eigenvector selection, are tested. We assess the performance of popular machine
learning models, including Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet, and
benchmark their accuracies in terms of cross-validated R2 values against models
that use only coordinates as features. We also extract coefficients and
functions from the models using GeoShapley and compare them with the true
processes. Results show that machine learning models using only location
coordinates achieve better accuracies than eigenvector-based approaches across
various experiments and datasets. Furthermore, we discuss that while these
findings are relevant for spatial processes that exhibit positive spatial
autocorrelation, they do not necessarily apply when modeling network
autocorrelation and cases with negative spatial autocorrelation, where Moran
Eigenvectors would still be useful.

Result: 算法在温和条件下收敛，并实证上显示出在二元和子群公平性方面的强大和灵活性。

Conclusion: 该框架可适应各种公平性概念，是处理监督学习中公平性的有力方法。

Abstract: In recent years, fairness in machine learning has emerged as a critical
concern to ensure that developed and deployed predictive models do not have
disadvantageous predictions for marginalized groups. It is essential to
mitigate discrimination against individuals based on protected attributes such
as gender and race. In this work, we consider applying subgroup justice
concepts to gradient-boosting machines designed for supervised learning
problems. Our approach expanded gradient-boosting methodologies to explore a
broader range of objective functions, which combines conventional losses such
as the ones from classification and regression and a min-max fairness term. We
study relevant theoretical properties of the solution of the min-max
optimization problem. The optimization process explored the primal-dual
problems at each boosting round. This generic framework can be adapted to
diverse fairness concepts. The proposed min-max primal-dual gradient boosting
algorithm was theoretically shown to converge under mild conditions and
empirically shown to be a powerful and flexible approach to address binary and
subgroup fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture of Experts预训练比密集Transformer更可扩展，但由于稀疏反向更新导致训练不稳定和性能不佳。

Method: Default MoE通过用专家输出历史指数移动平均的默认输出替换缺失的专家激活，使路由器为每个标记获得每个专家的信号。

Result: Default MoE在各种设置中显著改善训练性能，优于标准TopK路由，且不增加显著计算开销。

Conclusion: Default MoE方法有效地解决了MoE训练中的稀疏更新问题，提高了性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) pretraining is more scalable than dense Transformer
pretraining, because MoEs learn to route inputs to a sparse set of their
feedforward parameters. However, this means that MoEs only receive a sparse
backward update, leading to training instability and suboptimal performance. We
present a lightweight approximation method that gives the MoE router a dense
gradient update while continuing to sparsely activate its parameters. Our
method, which we refer to as Default MoE, substitutes missing expert
activations with default outputs consisting of an exponential moving average of
expert outputs previously seen over the course of training. This allows the
router to receive signals from every expert for each token, leading to
significant improvements in training performance. Our Default MoE outperforms
standard TopK routing in a variety of settings without requiring significant
computational overhead. Code: https://github.com/vatsal0/default-moe.

Conclusion: 为Transformer应用于符号数学问题提供了坚实基础，回应了Lample和Charton关于多样化输入训练的想法。

Abstract: The intersection of deep learning and symbolic mathematics has seen rapid
progress in recent years, exemplified by the work of Lample and Charton. They
demonstrated that effective training of machine learning models for solving
mathematical problems critically depends on high-quality, domain-specific
datasets. In this paper, we address the computation of Gr\"obner basis using
Transformers. While a dataset generation method tailored to Transformer-based
Gr\"obner basis computation has previously been proposed, it lacked theoretical
guarantees regarding the generality or quality of the generated datasets. In
this work, we prove that datasets generated by the previously proposed
algorithm are sufficiently general, enabling one to ensure that Transformers
can learn a sufficiently diverse range of Gr\"obner bases. Moreover, we propose
an extended and generalized algorithm to systematically construct datasets of
ideal generators, further enhancing the training effectiveness of Transformer.
Our results provide a rigorous geometric foundation for Transformers to address
a mathematical problem, which is an answer to Lample and Charton's idea of
training on diverse or representative inputs.

Method: 引入D2FT框架，使用三种选择策略优化注意力模块，并通过多背包优化解决分布式工作负载不平衡。

Result: 实验显示计算成本减少40%、通信成本减少50%，准确率下降1%至2%；在LoRA上扩展，准确率下降4%至6%。

Conclusion: D2FT框架有效降低微调成本，并可扩展到参数高效技术如LoRA。

Abstract: Fine-tuning plays a crucial role in adapting models to downstream tasks with
minimal training efforts. However, the rapidly increasing size of foundation
models poses a daunting challenge for accommodating foundation model
fine-tuning in most commercial devices, which often have limited memory
bandwidth. Techniques like model sharding and tensor parallelism address this
issue by distributing computation across multiple devices to meet memory
requirements. Nevertheless, these methods do not fully leverage their
foundation nature in facilitating the fine-tuning process, resulting in high
computational costs and imbalanced workloads. We introduce a novel Distributed
Dynamic Fine-Tuning (D2FT) framework that strategically orchestrates operations
across attention modules based on our observation that not all attention
modules are necessary for forward and backward propagation in fine-tuning
foundation models. Through three innovative selection strategies, D2FT
significantly reduces the computational workload required for fine-tuning
foundation models. Furthermore, D2FT addresses workload imbalances in
distributed computing environments by optimizing these selection strategies via
multiple knapsack optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed D2FT framework reduces the training computational costs by 40% and
training communication costs by 50% with only 1% to 2% accuracy drops on the
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Stanford Cars datasets. Moreover, the results show
that D2FT can be effectively extended to recent LoRA, a state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. By reducing 40% computational cost
or 50% communication cost, D2FT LoRA top-1 accuracy only drops 4% to 6% on
Stanford Cars dataset.

topics -- understudied research questions in synthetic data and evaluation --
and open questions for the field.

Result: 持续学习方法改善了性能，Replay策略在多个基准中与重新训练相当，但训练时间减少近一半。

Conclusion: 持续学习在工程工作流中具有潜力，代码和数据集可公开获取。

Abstract: Engineering problems that apply machine learning often involve
computationally intensive methods but rely on limited datasets. As engineering
data evolves with new designs and constraints, models must incorporate new
knowledge over time. However, high computational costs make retraining models
from scratch infeasible. Continual learning (CL) offers a promising solution by
enabling models to learn from sequential data while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, where a model forgets previously learned mappings. This work
introduces CL to engineering design by benchmarking several CL methods on
representative regression tasks. We apply these strategies to five engineering
datasets and construct nine new engineering CL benchmarks to evaluate their
ability to address forgetting and improve generalization. Preliminary results
show that applying existing CL methods to these tasks improves performance over
naive baselines. In particular, the Replay strategy achieved performance
comparable to retraining in several benchmarks while reducing training time by
nearly half, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering workflows.

Motivation: 长上下文语言模型性能出色，但高GPU内存需求导致部署困难。

Method: 提出MOM方法，将关键层分区为较小的'迷你序列'，并与KV缓存卸载无缝集成。

Result: 实验显示，MOM平均减少内存使用超过50%，将上下文长度扩展至原来的近三倍，保持准确性和吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该方法消除prefill内存瓶颈，改变研究优先级，转向优化decode阶段KV缓存效率。

Abstract: Long-context language models exhibit impressive performance but remain
challenging to deploy due to high GPU memory demands during inference. We
propose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that
partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" and integrates
seamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and
Mistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\% on
average. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k
to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and
not compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due
to minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared
to traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\% greater context
length extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill
memory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory
bottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research
priorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to
improving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.

Result: 发现扩散模型学习到的分布类似于训练分布但填补了'间隙'，归因于训练中噪声目标的协方差结构。

Conclusion: 表征了这种归纳偏差如何与特征相关的归纳偏差互动。

Abstract: How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and
is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score
matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score
function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn
the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy.
We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its
target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only
equal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent
diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory
that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our
theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to
compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and
overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion
models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions,
but with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the
covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also
characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive
biases.

Result: 实证结果显示，该方法在满足未知安全定义和扩展到各种连续控制任务中有效。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了未知安全约束的问题，并证明了其可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align
the agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including
cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires
anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general
setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from
sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety
model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact
on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their
corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory
is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to
demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep.
Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and
derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally,
our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is
effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various
continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: 提供路线图，指导本地预测者使用自身数据微调全球模型，促进ML-based洪水预测系统的操作部署。

Abstract: Floods are the most common form of natural disaster and accurate flood
forecasting is essential for early warning systems. Previous work has shown
that machine learning (ML) models are a promising way to improve flood
predictions when trained on large, geographically-diverse datasets. This
requirement of global training can result in a loss of ownership for national
forecasters who cannot easily adapt the models to improve performance in their
region, preventing ML models from being operationally deployed. Furthermore,
traditional hydrology research with physics-based models suggests that local
data -- which in many cases is only accessible to local agencies -- is valuable
for improving model performance. To address these concerns, we demonstrate a
methodology of pre-training a model on a large, global dataset and then
fine-tuning that model on data from individual basins. This results in
performance increases, validating our hypothesis that there is extra
information to be captured in local data. In particular, we show that
performance increases are most significant in watersheds that underperform
during global training. We provide a roadmap for national forecasters who wish
to take ownership of global models using their own data, aiming to lower the
barrier to operational deployment of ML-based hydrological forecast systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中，策略梯度方法擅长利用但探索不足，进化计算方法擅长探索但利用不足，需要整合二者以提高样本效率。

Method: 提出Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO)，将神经进化与策略梯度方法混合优化策略。

Result: 在Atari Pong和Breakout基准测试中，EPO提升了策略质量和样本效率，优于标准策略梯度和进化计算方法。

Conclusion: EPO适用于需要同时进行探索和局部优化的任务。

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off without sacrificing sample efficiency.
Policy gradient (PG) methods excel in exploitation through fine-grained,
gradient-based optimization but often struggle with exploration due to their
focus on local search. In contrast, evolutionary computation (EC) methods excel
in global exploration, but lack mechanisms for exploitation. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a
hybrid algorithm that integrates neuroevolution with policy gradient methods
for policy optimization. EPO leverages the exploration capabilities of EC and
the exploitation strengths of PG, offering an efficient solution to the

TL;DR: MagMatch是一种新的OSSL框架，通过原型-based对比学习隔离OOD样本，在分类和OOD检测上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OSSL方法在处理可能包含ID和OOD的未标注数据时 suboptimal，论文旨在解决这一实际挑战。

Method: 提出MagMatch框架，使用ID-Selective Magnetic模块和Selective Magnetic Alignment损失，选择性地对齐ID样本原型，而让OOD样本不对齐。

Result: 在多种数据集上，MagMatch在闭集分类准确率和OOD检测AUROC上显著优于现有方法，尤其在泛化到未见OOD数据时。

Conclusion: MagMatch是一种有效的OSSL方法，能够更好地处理OOD样本并提升整体性能。

Abstract: Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning (OSSL) tackles the practical challenge of
learning from unlabeled data that may include both in-distribution (ID) and
unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. However, existing OSSL methods form
suboptimal feature spaces by either excluding OOD samples, interfering with
them, or overtrusting their information during training. In this work, we
introduce MagMatch, a novel framework that naturally isolates OOD samples
through a prototype-based contrastive learning paradigm. Unlike conventional
methods, MagMatch does not assign any prototypes to OOD samples; instead, it
selectively aligns ID samples with class prototypes using an ID-Selective
Magnetic (ISM) module, while allowing OOD samples - the "others" - to remain
unaligned in the feature space. To support this process, we propose Selective
Magnetic Alignment (SMA) loss for unlabeled data, which dynamically adjusts
alignment based on sample confidence. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate that MagMatch significantly outperforms existing methods in both
closed-set classification accuracy and OOD detection AUROC, especially in
generalizing to unseen OOD data.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出FedDua方法，用于联邦学习中处理客户端数据量报告不准确的问题，通过梯度预测数据量，提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统加权平均易受不诚实客户端虚假报告数据量影响，导致模型偏差。

Method: 提出FedDua，通过分析客户端上传的模型梯度预测数据量，并可集成到任何联邦学习聚合算法中。

Result: 实验在三个数据集上显示，FedDua比四种流行方法平均提高3.17%的全局模型性能。

Conclusion: FedDua有效解决数据量报告不准确问题，提升联邦学习的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of deep learning
models without requiring data to leave local clients, thereby preserving client
privacy. The aggregation process on the server plays a critical role in the
performance of the resulting FL model. The most commonly used aggregation
method is weighted averaging based on the amount of data from each client,
which is thought to reflect each client's contribution. However, this method is
prone to model bias, as dishonest clients might report inaccurate training data
volumes to the server, which is hard to verify. To address this issue, we
propose a novel secure \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}ata
q\underline{u}antity-\underline{a}ware weighted averaging method (FedDua). It
enables FL servers to accurately predict the amount of training data from each
client based on their local model gradients uploaded. Furthermore, it can be
seamlessly integrated into any FL algorithms that involve server-side model
aggregation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarking datasets demonstrate
that FedDua improves the global model performance by an average of 3.17%
compared to four popular FL aggregation methods in the presence of inaccurate
client data volume declarations.

TL;DR: 本论文引入ChemKANs框架，通过整合物理知识和元素守恒损失，提高化学动力学模型在燃烧问题中的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学动力学模型推断面临大型ODE系统、时间尺度分离、非线性和噪声数据的挑战，机器学习应用困难。

Method: 开发ChemKANs，通过在KAN-ODE基础上添加物理知识、动力学定律、热力学定律和元素守恒损失，实现高效训练和参数稀疏。

Result: ChemKANs在稀疏噪声数据上无过拟合，优于DeepONet；一个仅344参数的模型可准确模拟氢燃烧，提供2倍加速，并可扩展到湍流模拟。

Conclusion: ChemKANs在燃烧物理和化学动力学中具有潜力，展示了KAN-ODEs在更大挑战问题中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Efficient chemical kinetic model inference and application for combustion
problems is challenging due to large ODE systems and wideley separated time
scales. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to streamline these
models, though strong nonlinearity and numerical stiffness combined with noisy
data sources makes their application challenging. The recently developed
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and KAN ordinary differential equations
(KAN-ODEs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for scientific applications
thanks to their rapid neural scaling, improved interpretability, and smooth
activation functions. Here, we develop ChemKANs by augmenting the KAN-ODE
framework with physical knowledge of the flow of information through the
relevant kinetic and thermodynamic laws, as well as an elemental conservation
loss term. This novel framework encodes strong inductive bias that enables
streamlined training and higher accuracy predictions, while facilitating
parameter sparsity through full sharing of information across all inputs and
outputs. In a model inference investigation, we find that ChemKANs exhibit no
overfitting or model degradation when tasked with extracting predictive models
from data that is both sparse and noisy, a task that a standard DeepONet
struggles to accomplish. Next, we find that a remarkably parameter-lean ChemKAN
(only 344 parameters) can accurately represent hydrogen combustion chemistry,
providing a 2x acceleration over the detailed chemistry in a solver that is
generalizable to larger-scale turbulent flow simulations. These demonstrations
indicate potential for ChemKANs in combustion physics and chemical kinetics,
and demonstrate the scalability of generic KAN-ODEs in significantly larger and
more numerically challenging problems than previously studied.

Conclusion: 结果表明，通过多任务公平aware学习可以缓解决策树模型中的算法偏差，代码和数据集可公开获取。

Abstract: Discrimination-aware classification aims to make accurate predictions while
satisfying fairness constraints. Traditional decision tree learners typically
optimize for information gain in the target attribute alone, which can result
in models that unfairly discriminate against protected social groups (e.g.,
gender, ethnicity). Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose GroupCART, a
tree-based ensemble optimizer that avoids bias during model construction by
optimizing not only for decreased entropy in the target attribute but also for
increased entropy in protected attributes. Our experiments show that GroupCART
achieves fairer models without data transformation and with minimal performance
degradation. Furthermore, the method supports customizable weighting, offering
a smooth and flexible trade-off between predictive performance and fairness
based on user requirements. These results demonstrate that algorithmic bias in
decision tree models can be mitigated through multi-task, fairness-aware
learning. All code and datasets used in this study are available at:

Motivation: Transformer在各种模态上表现出色，但迁移到图学习时往往需要复杂的修改，本文旨在简化这一过程以便更容易采用Transformer的训练进展。

Method: 提出三个修改：(1) 简化的L2注意力来测量标记的大小接近度；(2) 自适应的均方根归一化来保留标记大小信息；(3) 带有共享编码器的相对位置编码偏差。

Result: 在各种图数据集上获得显著性能提升，并在图同构性基准测试中显示出显著的表达性。

Conclusion: 这些修改的有效性通过经验证据得到证实，证明了在图学习中采用简单Transformer修改的潜力。

Abstract: Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities,
employing scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have
attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph
Transformers are designed with major architectural differences, either
integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention
mechanisms. These complexities prevent the easy adoption of Transformer
training advances. We propose three simple modifications to the plain
Transformer to render it applicable to graphs without introducing major
architectural distortions. Specifically, we advocate for the use of (1)
simplified $L_2$ attention to measure the magnitude closeness of tokens; (2)
adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude
information; and (3) a relative positional encoding bias with a shared encoder.
Significant performance gains across a variety of graph datasets justify the
effectiveness of our proposed modifications. Furthermore, empirical evaluation
on the expressiveness benchmark reveals noteworthy realized expressiveness in
the graph isomorphism.

Result: 以少量样本（如TruthfulQA的10个）实现误差小至3.37%的性能估计，并有理论保证。

Conclusion: BetaConform框架在理论和经验上验证，是一种高效的估计方法。

Abstract: LLM ensembles are widely used for LLM judges. However, how to estimate their
accuracy, especially in an efficient way, is unknown. In this paper, we present
a principled maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for an economical and precise
estimation of the performance of LLM ensemble judgment. We first propose a
mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the judgment distribution,
revising from the vanilla Binomial distribution. Next, we introduce a conformal
prediction-driven approach that enables adaptive stopping during iterative
sampling to balance accuracy with efficiency. Furthermore, we design a prior
transfer mechanism that utilizes learned distributions on open-source datasets
to improve estimation on a target dataset when only scarce annotations are
available. Finally, we present BetaConform, a framework that integrates our
distribution assumption, adaptive stopping, and the prior transfer mechanism to
deliver a theoretically guaranteed distribution estimation of LLM ensemble
judgment with minimum labeled samples. BetaConform is also validated
empirically. For instance, with only 10 samples from the TruthfulQA dataset,
for a Llama ensembled judge, BetaConform gauges its performance with error
margin as small as 3.37%.

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery algorithms utilize many statistical tests
for conditional independence to uncover networks of causal dependencies. These
approaches to causal discovery rely on an assumed correspondence between the
graphical properties of a causal structure and the conditional independence
properties of observed variables, known as the causal Markov condition and
faithfulness. Finite data yields an empirical distribution that is "close" to
the actual distribution. Across these many possible empirical distributions,
the correspondence to the graphical properties can break down for different
conditional independencies, and multiple violations can occur at the same time.
We study this "meta-dependence" between conditional independence properties
using the following geometric intuition: each conditional independence property
constrains the space of possible joint distributions to a manifold. The
"meta-dependence" between conditional independences is informed by the position
of these manifolds relative to the true probability distribution. We provide a
simple-to-compute measure of this meta-dependence using information projections
and consolidate our findings empirically using both synthetic and real-world
data.

Motivation: 现有SGD收敛分析依赖Robbins-Monro条件，而实际中常用更广泛的步长方案，本文旨在桥接理论与实践的差距。

Method: 引入基于停止时间方法的novel分析框架，对SGD进行渐进收敛分析。

Result: 证明了在步长满足sum ε_t = ∞和sum ε_t^p < ∞ (p>2)条件下SGD的几乎处处收敛和L2收敛，无需全局Lipschitz连续性和松弛的高阶矩有界性。

Conclusion: 松弛的假设使理论结果更通用，提升了在实际场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is widely used in machine learning
research. Previous convergence analyses of SGD under the vanishing step-size
setting typically require Robbins-Monro conditions. However, in practice, a
wider variety of step-size schemes are frequently employed, yet existing
convergence results remain limited and often rely on strong assumptions. This
paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel analytical framework based on a
stopping-time method, enabling asymptotic convergence analysis of SGD under
more relaxed step-size conditions and weaker assumptions. In the non-convex
setting, we prove the almost sure convergence of SGD iterates for step-sizes $
\{ \epsilon_t \}_{t \geq 1} $ satisfying $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t =
+\infty$ and $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t^p < +\infty$ for some $p > 2$.
Compared with previous studies, our analysis eliminates the global Lipschitz
continuity assumption on the loss function and relaxes the boundedness
requirements for higher-order moments of stochastic gradients. Building upon
the almost sure convergence results, we further establish $L_2$ convergence.
These significantly relaxed assumptions make our theoretical results more
general, thereby enhancing their applicability in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are intricate biological systems that control
gene expression and regulation in response to environmental and developmental
cues. Advances in computational biology, coupled with high throughput
sequencing technologies, have significantly improved the accuracy of GRN
inference and modeling. Modern approaches increasingly leverage artificial

supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and contrastive learning to analyze
large scale omics data and uncover regulatory gene interactions. To support
both the application of GRN inference in studying gene regulation and the
development of novel machine learning methods, we present a comprehensive
review of machine learning based GRN inference methodologies, along with the
datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used. Special emphasis is placed on
the emerging role of cutting edge deep learning techniques in enhancing
inference performance. The potential future directions for improving GRN
inference are also discussed.

Conclusion: 轻量级UQ方法可显著提高GNN-based材料建模的鲁棒性，并为未来与主动学习策略的整合奠定基础。

Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by
providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material
properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art
approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However,
GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data
and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge,
we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct
Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient
alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we
assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse
Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular
Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes
between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for
unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of
lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials
modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning
strategies.

Motivation: 由于深度学习模型在自动驾驶感知模块中至关重要，而对抗攻击可能导致严重后果，因此需要改进模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用AlexNet和VGG-16作为特征提取器，通过转移学习构建混合经典-量子深度学习模型，并测试超过1000个量子电路，对抗PGD、FGSA和GA攻击。

Result: HCQ-DL模型在无攻击场景下准确率超过95%，在GA和FGSA攻击下超过91%，在PGD攻击下AlexNet-based模型准确率达85%，均优于C-DL模型。

Conclusion: 结果表明，HCQ-DL模型在对抗设置下提供了更高的交通标志分类准确率。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based image classification models are essential for
autonomous vehicle (AV) perception modules since incorrect categorization might
have severe repercussions. Adversarial attacks are widely studied cyberattacks
that can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output, such as incorrectly
classified traffic signs by the perception module of an autonomous vehicle. In
this study, we create and compare hybrid classical-quantum deep learning
(HCQ-DL) models with classical deep learning (C-DL) models to demonstrate
robustness against adversarial attacks for perception modules. Before feeding
them into the quantum system, we used transfer learning models, alexnet and
vgg-16, as feature extractors. We tested over 1000 quantum circuits in our
HCQ-DL models for projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack
(FGSA), and gradient attack (GA), which are three well-known untargeted
adversarial approaches. We evaluated the performance of all models during
adversarial attacks and no-attack scenarios. Our HCQ-DL models maintain
accuracy above 95\% during a no-attack scenario and above 91\% for GA and FGSA
attacks, which is higher than C-DL models. During the PGD attack, our
alexnet-based HCQ-DL model maintained an accuracy of 85\% compared to C-DL
models that achieved accuracies below 21\%. Our results highlight that the
HCQ-DL models provide improved accuracy for traffic sign classification under
adversarial settings compared to their classical counterparts.

Motivation: 传统特征选择方法在正负不平衡学习中可能因将无标签数据视为负样本而无法捕获正样本统计特性，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出FSCPU方法，将特征选择问题表述为二元优化任务，目标函数融入聚类假设。

Result: 在合成数据集上显示有效性，与10种传统算法在三个公开数据集比较中，FSCPU在分类任务中表现出色，即使聚类假设不严格成立。

Conclusion: FSCPU是一种有效的特征选择方法，适用于正负不平衡学习场景，具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Feature selection is essential for efficient data mining and sometimes
encounters the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning scenario, where only a few
positive labels are available, while most data remains unlabeled. In certain
real-world PU learning tasks, data subjected to adequate feature selection
often form clusters with concentrated positive labels. Conventional feature
selection methods that treat unlabeled data as negative may fail to capture the
statistical characteristics of positive data in such scenarios, leading to
suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel feature selection
method based on the cluster assumption in PU learning, called FSCPU. FSCPU
formulates the feature selection problem as a binary optimization task, with an
objective function explicitly designed to incorporate the cluster assumption in
the PU learning setting. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of FSCPU across various data conditions. Moreover, comparisons
with 10 conventional algorithms on three open datasets show that FSCPU achieves
competitive performance in downstream classification tasks, even when the
cluster assumption does not strictly hold.

Conclusion: VLMGuard-R1框架证明了多模态推理驱动提示重写的有效性，能够显著提高视觉语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to
mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating
vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional
safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to
preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM
safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce
VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a
reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to
deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures
without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a
three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter
to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic
refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal
that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1
achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on
the SIUO benchmark.

Abstract: Drivers' perception of risk determines their acceptance, trust, and use of
the Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). However, perceived risk is subjective and
difficult to evaluate using existing methods. To address this issue, a driver's
subjective perceived risk (DSPR) model is proposed, regarding perceived risk as
a dynamically triggered mechanism with anisotropy and attenuation. 20
participants are recruited for a driver-in-the-loop experiment to report their
real-time subjective risk ratings (SRRs) when experiencing various automatic
driving scenarios. A convolutional neural network and bidirectional long
short-term memory network with temporal pattern attention (CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA) is
embedded into a semi-supervised learning strategy to predict SRRs, aiming to
reduce data noise caused by subjective randomness of participants. The results
illustrate that DSPR achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 87.91% in
predicting SRRs, compared to three state-of-the-art risk models. The
semi-supervised strategy improves accuracy by 20.12%. Besides, CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA
network presents the highest accuracy among four different LSTM structures.
This study offers an effective method for assessing driver's perceived risk,
providing support for the safety enhancement of ADS and driver's trust
improvement.

Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by
integrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural
network. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges
with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN
frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which
could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN
learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation
of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially
observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation
of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message
Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach
tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the
fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github
link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear
dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the
system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL
outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.

Result: 当任务联合线性可分时，模型方向收敛到联合最大边际解；循环顺序下，遗忘量趋于零；非可分情况下收敛到联合损失最小值。

Conclusion: 任务对齐与遗忘密切相关，循环训练可减少遗忘并确保收敛，揭示了持续学习的潜在机制。

Abstract: We study continual learning on multiple linear classification tasks by
sequentially running gradient descent (GD) for a fixed budget of iterations per
task. When all tasks are jointly linearly separable and are presented in a
cyclic/random order, we show the directional convergence of the trained linear
classifier to the joint (offline) max-margin solution. This is surprising
because GD training on a single task is implicitly biased towards the
individual max-margin solution for the task, and the direction of the joint
max-margin solution can be largely different from these individual solutions.
Additionally, when tasks are given in a cyclic order, we present a
non-asymptotic analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting, revealing that (1)
alignment between tasks is indeed closely tied to catastrophic forgetting and
backward knowledge transfer and (2) the amount of forgetting vanishes to zero
as the cycle repeats. Lastly, we analyze the case where the tasks are no longer
jointly separable and show that the model trained in a cyclic order converges
to the unique minimum of the joint loss function.

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning has gained significant attention recently.
However, many existing approaches heavily depend on perturbations, and
inappropriate perturbations may corrupt the graph's inherent information. The
Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is a powerful autoencoder
extensively used in fields such as computer vision; however, its application to
graph data remains underexplored. In this paper, we provide an empirical
analysis of vector quantization in the context of graph autoencoders,
demonstrating its significant enhancement of the model's capacity to capture
graph topology. Furthermore, we identify two key challenges associated with
vector quantization when applying in graph data: codebook underutilization and
codebook space sparsity. For the first challenge, we propose an annealing-based
encoding strategy that promotes broad code utilization in the early stages of
training, gradually shifting focus toward the most effective codes as training
progresses. For the second challenge, we introduce a hierarchical two-layer
codebook that captures relationships between embeddings through clustering. The
second layer codebook links similar codes, encouraging the model to learn
closer embeddings for nodes with similar features and structural topology in
the graph. Our proposed model outperforms 16 representative baseline methods in
self-supervised link prediction and node classification tasks across multiple
datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了高维压缩框架在LTSF中的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF)
often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like
linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In
this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key
techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are
frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these
ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce
TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information
compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified
framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating
temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to
capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We
propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain,
supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the
learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule
can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 证明个性化特征选择方法必要且有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence methods are increasingly applied to complex task
scenarios, high dimensional multi-label learning has emerged as a prominent
research focus. At present, the curse of dimensionality remains one of the
major bottlenecks in high-dimensional multi-label learning, which can be
effectively addressed through multi-label feature selection methods. However,
existing multi-label feature selection methods mostly focus on identifying
global features shared across all labels, which overlooks personalized
characteristics and specific requirements of individual labels. This
global-only perspective may limit the ability to capture label-specific
discriminative information, thereby affecting overall performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and
Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection). GPMFS firstly
identifies global features by exploiting label correlations, then adaptively
supplements each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features
using a threshold-controlled strategy. Experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate that GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining
strong interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, GPMFS provides insights
into the label-specific strength across different multi-label datasets, thereby
demonstrating the necessity and potential applicability of personalized feature
selection approaches.

Conclusion: 结论是通过理论分析和实证实验，证明DEPOSITUM在神经网络训练中的优越性。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) eliminates the reliance on the
server-client architecture inherent in traditional federated learning,
attracting significant research interest in recent years. Simultaneously, the
objective functions in machine learning tasks are often nonconvex and
frequently incorporate additional, potentially nonsmooth regularization terms
to satisfy practical requirements, thereby forming nonconvex composite
optimization problems. Employing DFL methods to solve such general optimization
problems leads to the formulation of Decentralized Nonconvex Composite
Federated Learning (DNCFL), a topic that remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we propose a novel DNCFL algorithm, termed \bf{DEPOSITUM}. Built upon
proximal stochastic gradient tracking, DEPOSITUM mitigates the impact of data
heterogeneity by enabling clients to approximate the global gradient. The
introduction of momentums in the proximal gradient descent step, replacing
tracking variables, reduces the variance introduced by stochastic gradients.
Additionally, DEPOSITUM supports local updates of client variables,
significantly reducing communication costs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that DEPOSITUM achieves an expected $\epsilon$-stationary point with an
iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. The proximal gradient,
consensus errors, and gradient estimation errors decrease at a sublinear rate
of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$. With appropriate parameter selection, the algorithm
achieves network-independent linear speedup without requiring mega-batch
sampling. Finally, we apply DEPOSITUM to the training of neural networks on
real-world datasets, systematically examining the influence of various
hyperparameters on its performance. Comparisons with other federated composite
optimization algorithms validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: Sign-In是一种正交方法，有助于PaI，但完全关闭性能差距仍是一个开放挑战。

Abstract: The performance gap between training sparse neural networks from scratch
(PaI) and dense-to-sparse training presents a major roadblock for efficient
deep learning. According to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, PaI hinges on
finding a problem specific parameter initialization. As we show, to this end,
determining correct parameter signs is sufficient. Yet, they remain elusive to
PaI. To address this issue, we propose Sign-In, which employs a dynamic
reparameterization that provably induces sign flips. Such sign flips are
complementary to the ones that dense-to-sparse training can accomplish,
rendering Sign-In as an orthogonal method. While our experiments and theory
suggest performance improvements of PaI, they also carve out the main open
challenge to close the gap between PaI and dense-to-sparse training.

Abstract: The loss landscape of Variational Quantum Neural Networks (VQNNs) is
characterized by local minima that grow exponentially with increasing qubits.
Because of this, it is more challenging to recover information from model
gradients during training compared to classical Neural Networks (NNs). In this
paper we present a numerical scheme that successfully reconstructs input
training, real-world, practical data from trainable VQNNs' gradients. Our
scheme is based on gradient inversion that works by combining gradients
estimation with the finite difference method and adaptive low-pass filtering.
The scheme is further optimized with Kalman filter to obtain efficient
convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm can invert even
batch-trained data, given the VQNN model is sufficiently over-parameterized.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Permutation Decision Trees (PDT)
and strategic trailing for predicting stock market movements and executing
profitable trades in the Indian stock market. We focus on high-frequency data
using 5-minute candlesticks for the top 50 stocks listed in the NIFTY 50 index.
We implement a trading strategy that aims to buy stocks at lower prices and
sell them at higher prices, capitalizing on short-term market fluctuations. Due
to regulatory constraints in India, short selling is not considered in our
strategy. The model incorporates various technical indicators and employs
hyperparameters such as the trailing stop-loss value and support thresholds to
manage risk effectively. Our results indicate that the proposed trading bot has
the potential to outperform the market average and yield returns higher than
the risk-free rate offered by 10-year Indian government bonds. We trained and
tested data on a 60 day dataset provided by Yahoo Finance. Specifically, 12
days for testing and 48 days for training. Our bot based on permutation
decision tree achieved a profit of 1.3468 % over a 12-day testing period, where
as a bot based on LSTM gave a return of 0.1238 % over a 12-day testing period
and a bot based on RNN gave a return of 0.3096 % over a 12-day testing period.
All of the bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy, which resulted in a loss
of 2.2508 %.

Result: 实验显示 FedX 改善了量化时间（最高 8.43 倍）、设备计算时间（1.5 倍）和端到端训练时间（1.36 倍），并提供了收敛保证。

Conclusion: FedX 通过结合 FL 和模型量化提高了训练效率，并理论和实证验证了模型收敛。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training among multiple devices
without data sharing, thus enabling privacy-sensitive applications on mobile or
Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as mobile health and asset tracking.
However, designing an FL system with good model utility that works with low
computation/communication overhead on heterogeneous, resource-constrained
mobile/IoT devices is challenging. To address this problem, this paper proposes
FedX, a novel adaptive model decomposition and quantization FL system for IoT.
To balance utility with resource constraints on IoT devices, FedX decomposes a
global FL model into different sub-networks with adaptive numbers of quantized
bits for different devices. The key idea is that a device with fewer resources
receives a smaller sub-network for lower overhead but utilizes a larger number
of quantized bits for higher model utility, and vice versa. The quantization
operations in FedX are done at the server to reduce the computational load on
devices. FedX iteratively minimizes the losses in the devices' local data and
in the server's public data using quantized sub-networks under a regularization
term, and thus it maximizes the benefits of combining FL with model
quantization through knowledge sharing among the server and devices in a
cost-effective training process. Extensive experiments show that FedX
significantly improves quantization times by up to 8.43X, on-device computation
time by 1.5X, and total end-to-end training time by 1.36X, compared with
baseline FL systems. We guarantee the global model convergence theoretically
and validate local model convergence empirically, highlighting FedX's
optimization efficiency.

Conclusion: Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe是处理不平衡数据集的强有力方法，强调噪声减少和异常值处理以提升分类模型。

Abstract: Classifying imbalanced datasets remains a significant challenge in machine
learning, particularly with big data where instances are unevenly distributed
among classes, leading to class imbalance issues that impact classifier
performance. While Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) addresses
this challenge by generating new instances for the under-represented minority
class, it faces obstacles in the form of noise and outliers during the creation
of new samples. In this paper, a proposed approach, iHHO-SMOTe, which addresses
the limitations of SMOTE by first cleansing the data from noise points. This
process involves employing feature selection using a random forest to identify
the most valuable features, followed by applying the Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect outliers
based on the selected features. The identified outliers from the minority
classes are then removed, creating a refined dataset for subsequent
oversampling using the hybrid approach called iHHO-SMOTe. The comprehensive
experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of
the proposed model, with an AUC score exceeding 0.99, a high G-means score of
0.99 highlighting its robustness, and an outstanding F1-score consistently
exceeding 0.967. These findings collectively establish Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe as a
formidable contender in addressing imbalanced datasets, focusing on noise
reduction and outlier handling for improved classification models.

Method: 开发CollaPois攻击，将木马感染模型分发给受损客户端，协作产生恶意梯度，使模型收敛到感染区域。

Result: CollaPois优于现有攻击，能绕过防御，尤其在数据分布多样化场景下，且少量受损客户端即可有效。

Conclusion: 突显联邦学习安全风险，证明CollaPois在非IID数据下的有效性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training using
decentralized private data from multiple clients. While FL has shown robustness
against poisoning attacks with basic defenses, our research reveals new
vulnerabilities stemming from non-independent and identically distributed
(non-IID) data among clients. These vulnerabilities pose a substantial risk of
model poisoning in real-world FL scenarios.
  To demonstrate such vulnerabilities, we develop a novel collaborative
backdoor poisoning attack called CollaPois. In this attack, we distribute a
single pre-trained model infected with a Trojan to a group of compromised
clients. These clients then work together to produce malicious gradients,
causing the FL model to consistently converge towards a low-loss region
centered around the Trojan-infected model. Consequently, the impact of the
Trojan is amplified, especially when the benign clients have diverse local data
distributions and scattered local gradients. CollaPois stands out by achieving
its goals while involving only a limited number of compromised clients, setting
it apart from existing attacks. Also, CollaPois effectively avoids noticeable
shifts or degradation in the FL model's performance on legitimate data samples,
allowing it to operate stealthily and evade detection by advanced robust FL
algorithms.
  Thorough theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on various benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of CollaPois compared to state-of-the-art
backdoor attacks. Notably, CollaPois bypasses existing backdoor defenses,
especially in scenarios where clients possess diverse data distributions.
Moreover, the results show that CollaPois remains effective even when involving
a small number of compromised clients. Notably, clients whose local data is
closely aligned with compromised clients experience higher risks of backdoor
infections.

Conclusion: Bird-MAE 和原型探测方法证明了在领域特定音频任务中，专用模型和高效探测技术能显著提高性能和效率。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) pretrained on AudioSet fail to capture the
fine-grained acoustic characteristics of specialized domains such as
bioacoustic monitoring. Bird sound classification is critical for assessing
environmental health, yet general-purpose models inadequately address its
unique acoustic challenges. To address this, we introduce Bird-MAE, a
domain-specialized MAE pretrained on the large-scale BirdSet dataset. We
explore adjustments to pretraining, fine-tuning and utilizing frozen
representations. Bird-MAE achieves state-of-the-art results across all BirdSet
downstream tasks, substantially improving multi-label classification
performance compared to the general-purpose Audio-MAE baseline. Additionally,
we propose prototypical probing, a parameter-efficient method for leveraging
MAEs' frozen representations. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear
probing by up to 37\% in MAP and narrow the gap to fine-tuning to approximately
3\% on average on BirdSet.

Conclusion: 建议使用动态权重衰减调度，利用正则化的持久效果以提升模型泛化性能。

Abstract: Implicit bias plays an important role in explaining how overparameterized
models generalize well. Explicit regularization like weight decay is often
employed in addition to prevent overfitting. While both concepts have been
studied separately, in practice, they often act in tandem. Understanding their
interplay is key to controlling the shape and strength of implicit bias, as it
can be modified by explicit regularization. To this end, we incorporate
explicit regularization into the mirror flow framework and analyze its lasting
effects on the geometry of the training dynamics, covering three distinct
effects: positional bias, type of bias, and range shrinking. Our analytical
approach encompasses a broad class of problems, including sparse coding, matrix
sensing, single-layer attention, and LoRA, for which we demonstrate the utility
of our insights. To exploit the lasting effect of regularization and highlight
the potential benefit of dynamic weight decay schedules, we propose to switch
off weight decay during training, which can improve generalization, as we
demonstrate in experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示Transformer模型中ICL的神秘底层机制。

Method: 推导线性Transformer的SGD动态，并引入理论启发的宏观测量如谱秩动态和子空间稳定性。

Result: 发现时间尺度分离、分阶段学习、固定点、守恒定律和非线性行为，并解释ICL的突然出现和延迟泛化。

Conclusion: 提供精确的ICL动态模型和理论工具，用于分析Transformer训练。

Abstract: Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to
novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms
remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical
characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing
regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation
of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure,
leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops,
including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation
laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning
behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology
extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired
macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them
to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in
attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular
arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and
theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of using wrist-worn inertial sensors to

is commonly used to assess upper limb motor function, its limitations include
subjectivity and time consumption of clinical staff. By using IMU (Inertial

recordings. We test common preprocessing strategies to efficiently leverage
included information in the data. Afterward, we use the best preprocessing to
improve the classification. The dataset includes recordings of 45 participants
performing various ARAT items. Results show that MiniROCKET offers a fast and

TL;DR: RL-PINNs 通过强化学习实现高效单轮自适应采样，提高 PINNs 求解 PDE 的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs 性能依赖训练点选择策略，传统自适应采样方法需多轮采样和重复训练，计算效率低下，尤其在高维或高阶导数场景。

Method: 提出 RL-PINNs 框架，将自适应采样建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用 RL 代理最大化长期效用选择点，采用函数变异作为奖励信号，并使用延迟奖励机制。

Result: 实验显示 RL-PINNs 在各种 PDE 基准上准确性优于现有方法，采样开销微小，可扩展到高维和高阶问题。

Conclusion: RL-PINNs 提供高效 PINNs 训练方法，提升计算效率和准确性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their performance
heavily relies on the strategy used to select training points. Conventional
adaptive sampling methods, such as residual-based refinement, often require
multi-round sampling and repeated retraining of PINNs, leading to computational
inefficiency due to redundant points and costly gradient
computations-particularly in high-dimensional or high-order derivative
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose RL-PINNs, a reinforcement
learning(RL)-driven adaptive sampling framework that enables efficient training
with only a single round of sampling. Our approach formulates adaptive sampling
as a Markov decision process, where an RL agent dynamically selects optimal
training points by maximizing a long-term utility metric. Critically, we
replace gradient-dependent residual metrics with a computationally efficient
function variation as the reward signal, eliminating the overhead of derivative
calculations. Furthermore, we employ a delayed reward mechanism to prioritize
long-term training stability over short-term gains. Extensive experiments
across diverse PDE benchmarks, including low-regular, nonlinear,
high-dimensional, and high-order problems, demonstrate that RL-PINNs
significantly outperforms existing residual-driven adaptive methods in
accuracy. Notably, RL-PINNs achieve this with negligible sampling overhead,
making them scalable to high-dimensional and high-order problems.

improving search in highly expressive NAS search spaces based on context-free
grammars. We show that i) surrogate models trained either using zero-cost-proxy
metrics and neural graph features (GRAF) or by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf LM
have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and
across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad
architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding
up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can
be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications
but demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory
bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged
as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption.
Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight
bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance due to
high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical
optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory
access patterns, which are essential for efficient low-precision computations.
In this paper, we introduce a virtual machine (VM) designed for General-Purpose
GPU (GPGPU) computing, enabling support for low-precision data types with
arbitrary bit widths while maintaining GPU programmability. The proposed VM
features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a
novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision
data types. VM programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs with
automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VM efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision
data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels on their
supported types. Compared to existing compilers like Triton and Ladder, as well
as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, our VM achieves
performance improvements of 1.75x, 2.61x, 1.29x and 1.03x, respectively.

TL;DR: 本论文提出Top-k和Top-k(x) Learning-to-Defer框架，用于将不确定预测分配给多个代理，提高决策系统的可靠性和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Learning-to-Defer方法仅关注单代理递交，在高风险场景需要集体专业知识时不足够。

Method: 提出Top-k L2D和自适应Top-k(x) L2D框架，推导新代理损失函数，并证明其Bayes一致性和其他一致性。

Result: 实验在分类和回归任务上显示框架有效性，并将模型级联视为框架的特例。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多代理分配和自适应机制提升了决策系统的可靠性和灵活性。

Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables decision-making systems to improve
reliability by selectively deferring uncertain predictions to more competent
agents. However, most existing approaches focus exclusively on single-agent
deferral, which is often inadequate in high-stakes scenarios that require
collective expertise. We propose Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer, a generalization of
the classical two-stage L2D framework that allocates each query to the $k$ most
confident agents instead of a single one. To further enhance flexibility and
cost-efficiency, we introduce Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer, an adaptive
extension that learns the optimal number of agents to consult for each query,
based on input complexity, agent competency distributions, and consultation
costs. For both settings, we derive a novel surrogate loss and prove that it is
Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent, ensuring
convergence to the Bayes-optimal allocation. Notably, we show that the
well-established model cascades paradigm arises as a restricted instance of our
Top-$k$ and Top-$k(x)$ formulations. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both
classification and regression tasks.

Motivation: 动机是由于CoT的泛化能力在分布偏移下尚未被充分理解，需要进行系统研究。

Method: 方法包括扩展潜变量框架，并研究两种OOD场景：潜变量的排列组合和均匀缩放。

Result: 结果显示CoT推理在潜变量与训练数据相似的OOD样本上泛化有效，但当相似度减少时性能下降。

Conclusion: 结论提供了对CoT提示优势和局限性的洞见，并建议未来LLM开发更具弹性的推理策略。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique to
improve in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) by breaking
complex reasoning into intermediate steps. However, the ability of CoT to
generalize under distribution shift remains poorly understood. In this work, we
extend a latent-variable framework for CoT prompting and study its behavior on
two prototypical out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios: (i) the latent variables
for CoT steps are permuted into novel combinations, and (ii) the latent
variables uniformly scaled by a factor. Our experiments demonstrate that CoT
inference generalizes effectively to OOD samples whose latent variables closely
resemble those seen during training, but its performance degrades as this
similarity decreases. These findings provide foundational insights into the
strengths and limitations of CoT prompting under OOD conditions and suggest
directions for developing more resilient reasoning strategies in future LLMs.

Motivation: GNN在图分析中表现良好，但推理成本高，限制了其在大型图上的应用。

Method: 提出IFGC，包括推理等价关系和三种方案：SPGC、(α, r)-压缩和锚定压缩，并提供高效算法。

Result: 实验验证了在各种大规模图上方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: IFGC成功加速GNN推理，同时保持推理质量。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph
analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering
their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly
graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs
inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed
graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that
the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little
decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference
equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not
distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical
specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving
compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN
inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a
configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and
anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of
interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms
with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct
extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the
effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.

Motivation: 尽管单链蛋白质建模已取得进展，但多链蛋白质建模仍未充分探索，而多链蛋白质对理解生物功能至关重要，因此需要开发新的模型。

Method: 开发APM模型，整合原子级信息，利用多链蛋白质数据，精确建模链间相互作用，并支持从零开始设计、折叠和逆折叠任务。

Result: APM模型通过监督微调提升性能，支持零样本采样，在下游任务中达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: APM模型为多链蛋白质建模提供了强大工具，并计划发布代码以供进一步研究。

Abstract: Proteins typically exist in complexes, interacting with other proteins or
biomolecules to perform their specific biological roles. Research on
single-chain protein modeling has been extensively and deeply explored, with
advancements seen in models like the series of ESM and AlphaFold. Despite these
developments, the study and modeling of multi-chain proteins remain largely
uncharted, though they are vital for understanding biological functions.
Recognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (All-Atom
Protein Generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling
multi-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data
on multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain
interactions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from
scratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain
proteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it
achieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also
supporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results. Code will be released at https://github.com/bytedance/apm.

Method: 通过合成可识别性理论证据，展示PRH在SSL中的可能性，并提出扩展为奇异可识别性理论（SITh）以覆盖整个SSL管道。

Result: 证明PRH可出现在SSL中，但当前理论无法解释经验成功；SITh提供更广泛框架。

Conclusion: SITh可提升SSL的解释性和泛化性，并建议未来研究重点包括训练动态、样本影响和归纳偏差。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research
interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The
Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH),
suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all
representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon
lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from
Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However,
current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between
theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular
Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the
entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data
assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable
and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for
future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the
impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of
inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and
optimizers.

Conclusion: SHIFT 在复杂场景中表现出色，证明了其有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising
capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their
out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge,
particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to
ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral
Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that
uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors
derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory
prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic
spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels,
which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as
stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation
framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the
nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios,
demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In
particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where
uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page:

Abstract: While convolution and self-attention mechanisms have dominated architectural
design in deep learning, this survey examines a fundamental yet understudied
primitive: the Hadamard product. Despite its widespread implementation across
various applications, the Hadamard product has not been systematically analyzed
as a core architectural primitive. We present the first comprehensive taxonomy
of its applications in deep learning, identifying four principal domains:
higher-order correlation, multimodal data fusion, dynamic representation
modulation, and efficient pairwise operations. The Hadamard product's ability
to model nonlinear interactions with linear computational complexity makes it
particularly valuable for resource-constrained deployments and edge computing
scenarios. We demonstrate its natural applicability in multimodal fusion tasks,
such as visual question answering, and its effectiveness in representation
masking for applications including image inpainting and pruning. This
systematic review not only consolidates existing knowledge about the Hadamard
product's role in deep learning architectures but also establishes a foundation
for future architectural innovations. Our analysis reveals the Hadamard product
as a versatile primitive that offers compelling trade-offs between
computational efficiency and representational power, positioning it as a
crucial component in the deep learning toolkit.

Abstract: Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) has been the focus of a successful eradication
programme in Ireland, with the herd-level prevalence declining from 11.3% in
2013 to just 0.2% in 2023. As the country moves toward BVD freedom, the
development of predictive models for targeted surveillance becomes increasingly
important to mitigate the risk of disease re-emergence. In this study, we
evaluate the performance of a range of machine learning algorithms, including
binary classification and anomaly detection techniques, for predicting
BVD-positive herds using highly imbalanced herd-level data. We conduct an
extensive simulation study to assess model performance across varying sample
sizes and class imbalance ratios, incorporating resampling, class weighting,
and appropriate evaluation metrics (sensitivity, positive predictive value,
F1-score and AUC values). Random forests and XGBoost models consistently
outperformed other methods, with the random forest model achieving the highest

Abstract: Cold temperatures can cause significant frost damage to fruit crops depending
on their resilience, or cold hardiness, which changes throughout the dormancy

Unfortunately, cold-hardiness data for model training is only available for
some fruit cultivars due to the need for specialized equipment and expertise.
Rather, farmers often do have years of phenological data (e.g. date of
budbreak) that they regularly collect for their crops. In this work, we
introduce a new transfer-learning framework, Transfer via Auxiliary Labels
(TAL), that allows farmers to leverage the phenological data to produce more
accurate cold-hardiness predictions, even when no cold-hardiness data is
available for their specific crop. The framework assumes a set of source tasks
(cultivars) where each has associated primary labels (cold hardiness) and
auxiliary labels (phenology). However, the target task (new cultivar) is
assumed to only have the auxiliary labels. The goal of TAL is to predict
primary labels for the target task via transfer from the source tasks.
Surprisingly, despite the vast literature on transfer learning, to our
knowledge, the TAL formulation has not been previously addressed. Thus, we
propose several new TAL approaches based on model selection and averaging that
can leverage recent deep multi-task models for cold-hardiness prediction. Our
results on real-world cold-hardiness and phenological data for multiple grape
cultivars demonstrate that TAL can leverage the phenological data to improve
cold-hardiness predictions in the absence of cold-hardiness data.

Motivation: 为了评估新机械解释性方法是否真正改进，并追求有意义的持久评价标准。

Method: 提出MIB基准，包括电路定位和因果变量定位两个轨道，涉及四项任务和五种模型，比较方法如归因修补、信息流路由、稀疏自动编码器等。

Result: 电路定位中，归因和掩码优化方法最佳；因果变量定位中，监督DAS方法最佳，而SAE特征不优于神经元。

Conclusion: MIB能实现方法的有意义比较，并增强了对领域进步的信心。

Abstract: How can we know whether new mechanistic interpretability methods achieve real
improvements? In pursuit of meaningful and lasting evaluation standards, we
propose MIB, a benchmark with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models.
MIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal
pathways or specific causal variables in neural language models. The circuit
localization track compares methods that locate the model components - and
connections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g.,
attribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable
localization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g.,
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and locate
model features for a causal variable relevant to the task. Using MIB, we find
that attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit
localization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS
method performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e.,
standard dimensions of hidden vectors. These findings illustrate that MIB
enables meaningful comparisons of methods, and increases our confidence that
there has been real progress in the field.

Motivation: 受人类注意力偏差启发，旨在提升基础模型架构的效率和效果。

Method: 将架构视为关联记忆模块，引入替代注意力偏差目标和近似方法，重释遗忘机制，提出Miras框架，包括关联记忆、注意力偏差、保留门和记忆学习算法的设计选择，并开发Moneta、Yaad和Memora模型。

Result: 实验显示Miras不同设计在语言建模、常识推理和回忆密集任务中表现出色，超越Transformer和现代线性RNN，同时保持快速并行训练。

Conclusion: Miras框架提供了一种通用方法设计高效深度学习架构，不同选择可产生不同优势模型。

Abstract: Designing efficient and effective architectural backbones has been in the
core of research efforts to enhance the capability of foundation models.
Inspired by the human cognitive phenomenon of attentional bias-the natural
tendency to prioritize certain events or stimuli-we reconceptualize neural
architectures, including Transformers, Titans, and modern linear recurrent
neural networks as associative memory modules that learn a mapping of keys and
values using an internal objective, referred to as attentional bias.
Surprisingly, we observed that most existing sequence models leverage either
(1) dot-product similarity, or (2) L2 regression objectives as their
attentional bias. Going beyond these objectives, we present a set of
alternative attentional bias configurations along with their effective
approximations to stabilize their training procedure. We then reinterpret
forgetting mechanisms in modern deep learning architectures as a form of
retention regularization, providing a novel set of forget gates for sequence
models. Building upon these insights, we present Miras, a general framework to
design deep learning architectures based on four choices of: (i) associative
memory architecture, (ii) attentional bias objective, (iii) retention gate, and
(iv) memory learning algorithm. We present three novel sequence models-Moneta,
Yaad, and Memora-that go beyond the power of existing linear RNNs while
maintaining a fast parallelizable training process. Our experiments show
different design choices in Miras yield models with varying strengths. For
example, certain instances of Miras achieve exceptional performance in special
tasks such as language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and recall intensive
tasks, even outperforming Transformers and other modern linear recurrent
models.

Motivation: 解决CAD设计对齐问题，现有方法无法有效捕捉设计意图，导致约束不足或过度。

Method: 使用约束求解器反馈训练现有约束生成模型，采用对齐技术。

Result: 约束完整率达93%，优于监督微调的34%和无对齐的8.9%。

Conclusion: 方法可应用于任何约束生成模型，并为语言与设计领域对齐研究奠定基础。

Abstract: We adapt alignment techniques from reasoning LLMs to the task of generating
engineering sketch constraints found in computer-aided design (CAD) models.
Engineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines)
connected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the
relationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints
must effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates
predictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate
CAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design
intent, we label this problem `design alignment'. A critical first step towards
aligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain
all geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch
geometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation
model with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain
93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a na\"ive supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without alignment. Our approach can be applied to
any existing constraint generation model and sets the stage for further
research bridging alignment strategies between the language and design domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应视觉语言模型到新领域时，面临严重过拟合和计算限制，现有低秩方法难以泛化和需要大量超参数调整。

Method: 提出稀疏优化（SO）框架，包括局部稀疏与全局稠密、局部随机性与全局重要性两个范式，通过动态调整少量参数缓解过拟合。

Result: 在11个多样数据集上的实验显示，SO框架实现了最先进的少样本适应性能，并减少了内存开销。

Conclusion: SO方法显著缓解过拟合，确保低数据情境下的稳定适应，提高了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to new domains with few labeled
samples remains a significant challenge due to severe overfitting and
computational constraints. State-of-the-art solutions, such as low-rank
reparameterization, mitigate these issues but often struggle with
generalization and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, a
novel Sparse Optimization (SO) framework is proposed. Unlike low-rank
approaches that typically constrain updates to a fixed subspace, our SO method
leverages high sparsity to dynamically adjust very few parameters. We introduce
two key paradigms. First, we advocate for \textit{local sparsity and global
density}, which updates a minimal subset of parameters per iteration while
maintaining overall model expressiveness. As a second paradigm, we advocate for
\textit{local randomness and global importance}, which sparsifies the gradient
using random selection while pruning the first moment based on importance. This
combination significantly mitigates overfitting and ensures stable adaptation
in low-data regimes. Extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets show that SO
achieves state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation performance while reducing memory
overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比视频-语言预训练模型计算需求高，且仅处理短视频剪辑（4-64 帧），需要开发能适应计算资源的高效视频编码器。

Method: 引入 AdaVid 框架，使用自适应 transformer 块（受 Matryoshka 表示学习启发），在 Ego4D 数据集上训练；并提出轻量级分层网络处理长视频。

Result: AdaVid-EgoVLP 在相同或更少计算资源下匹配或超越标准 EgoVLP 性能；在 Diving48 等基准上实现更多帧处理而不超计算限；长视频基准上平衡计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: AdaVid 框架证明了在计算约束下提高视频编码器效率和适应性的有效性。

Abstract: Contrastive video-language pretraining has demonstrated great success in
learning rich and robust video representations. However, deploying such video
encoders on compute-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to their
high computational demands. Additionally, existing models are typically trained
to process only short video clips, often limited to 4 to 64 frames. In this
paper, we introduce AdaVid, a flexible architectural framework designed to
learn efficient video encoders that can dynamically adapt their computational
footprint based on available resources. At the heart of AdaVid is an adaptive
transformer block, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, which allows
the model to adjust its hidden embedding dimension at inference time. We show
that AdaVid-EgoVLP, trained on video-narration pairs from the large-scale Ego4D
dataset, matches the performance of the standard EgoVLP on short video-language
benchmarks using only half the compute, and even outperforms EgoVLP when given
equal computational resources. We further explore the trade-off between frame
count and compute on the challenging Diving48 classification benchmark, showing
that AdaVid enables the use of more frames without exceeding computational
limits. To handle longer videos, we also propose a lightweight hierarchical
network that aggregates short clip features, achieving a strong balance between
compute efficiency and accuracy across several long video benchmarks.

Motivation: 由于心脏超声检查需专家和高品质设备，仅限于医院，AI系统可辅助新手并扩展诊断范围。

Method: 使用心脏超声视频离线训练决策模型，通过二元分类检测IVC存在，并整合本地化算法实时标注位置。

Result: 模型在高品质视频上显示强本地化性能，在低品质手持设备视频上实现零样本出色表现。

Conclusion: 此系统促进超声诊断从医院扩展，目前正进行临床试验，可在Butterfly iQ app上使用。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging of the heart (echocardiography) is widely used to diagnose
cardiac diseases. However, obtaining an echocardiogram requires an expert
sonographer and a high-quality ultrasound imaging device, which are generally
only available in hospitals. Recently, AI-based navigation models and
algorithms have been used to aid novice sonographers in acquiring the
standardized cardiac views necessary to visualize potential disease
pathologies. These navigation systems typically rely on directional guidance to
predict the necessary rotation of the ultrasound probe. This paper demonstrates
a novel AI navigation system that builds on a decision model for identifying
the inferior vena cava (IVC) of the heart. The decision model is trained
offline using cardiac ultrasound videos and employs binary classification to
determine whether the IVC is present in a given ultrasound video. The
underlying model integrates a novel localization algorithm that leverages the
learned feature representations to annotate the spatial location of the IVC in
real-time. Our model demonstrates strong localization performance on
traditional high-quality hospital ultrasound videos, as well as impressive
zero-shot performance on lower-quality ultrasound videos from a more affordable
Butterfly iQ handheld ultrasound machine. This capability facilitates the
expansion of ultrasound diagnostics beyond hospital settings. Currently, the
guidance system is undergoing clinical trials and is available on the Butterfly
iQ app.

Motivation: 手术室工作流程优化需要隐私保护的计算机视觉方法，以减少成本、改善患者结果并解决隐私问题。

Method: 提出一个两阶段管道：第一阶段使用视觉基础模型进行深度估计和语义分割生成去标识化的数字孪生；第二阶段使用SafeOR模型处理分割掩码和深度图进行事件检测。

Result: 在38个模拟手术试验的数据集上，检测性能与原始RGB视频方法相当或更好，涵盖五类事件。

Conclusion: 数字孪生技术实现了隐私保护的手术室工作流程分析，促进数据共享并提高模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Purpose: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing
workflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. The use of
computer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative
events enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However,
privacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection
from OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR
workflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for
privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage,
we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic
segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from
conventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a
fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for
OR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38
simulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results
indicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves
performance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on
detecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow
analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions
and they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating
domain-specific appearance differences.

Result: 在五个下游任务上实验证明CM3AE有效性，并将开源代码和预训练模型。

Conclusion: CM3AE框架增强跨模态信息聚合和理解，为事件-based和RGB-Event融合任务提供稳健支持。

Abstract: Event cameras have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to
their advantages in high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, low power
consumption, and low latency. Some researchers have begun exploring
pre-training directly on event data. Nevertheless, these efforts often fail to
establish strong connections with RGB frames, limiting their applicability in
multi-modal fusion scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel CM3AE
pre-training framework for the RGB-Event perception. This framework accepts
multi-modalities/views of data as input, including RGB images, event images,
and event voxels, providing robust support for both event-based and RGB-event
fusion based downstream tasks. Specifically, we design a multi-modal fusion
reconstruction module that reconstructs the original image from fused
multi-modal features, explicitly enhancing the model's ability to aggregate
cross-modal complementary information. Additionally, we employ a multi-modal
contrastive learning strategy to align cross-modal feature representations in a
shared latent space, which effectively enhances the model's capability for
multi-modal understanding and capturing global dependencies. We construct a
large-scale dataset containing 2,535,759 RGB-Event data pairs for the
pre-training. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks fully demonstrated
the effectiveness of CM3AE. Source code and pre-trained models will be released
on https://github.com/Event-AHU/CM3AE.

Conclusion: Robo-SGG显著提升了鲁棒场景图生成的性能，并计划发布源代码和模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method named Robo-SGG, i.e.,
Layout-Oriented Normalization and Restitution for Robust Scene Graph
Generation. Compared to the existing SGG setting, the robust scene graph
generation aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images,
with the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted
images. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to
compromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To
obtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is
domain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted
images. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization(IN) to filter out the
domain-specific feature and recover the unchangeable structural features, i.e.,
the positional and semantic relationships among objects by the proposed
Layout-Oriented Restitution. Additionally, we propose a Layout-Embedded Encoder
(LEE) that augments the existing object and predicate encoders within the SGG
framework, enriching the robust positional and semantic features of objects and
predicates. Note that our proposed Robo-SGG module is designed as a
plug-and-play component, which can be easily integrated into any baseline SGG
model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating the
state-of-the-art method into our proposed Robo-SGG, we achieve relative
improvements of 5.6%, 8.0%, and 6.5% in mR@50 for PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet
tasks on the VG-C dataset, respectively, and achieve new state-of-the-art
performance in corruption scene graph generation benchmark (VG-C and GQA-C). We
will release our source code and model.

Conclusion: 整合地理空间信息可显著提高土地覆盖映射的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Land use and land cover mapping from Earth Observation (EO) data is a
critical tool for sustainable land and resource management. While advanced
machine learning and deep learning algorithms excel at analyzing EO imagery
data, they often overlook crucial geospatial metadata information that could
enhance scalability and accuracy across regional, continental, and global
scales. To address this limitation, we propose BRIDGE-LC (Bi-level
Representation Integration for Disentangled GEospatial Land Cover), a novel
deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale geospatial information into
the land cover classification process. By simultaneously leveraging
fine-grained (latitude/longitude) and coarse-grained (biogeographical region)
spatial information, our lightweight multi-layer perceptron architecture learns
from both during training but only requires fine-grained information for
inference, allowing it to disentangle region-specific from region-agnostic land
cover features while maintaining computational efficiency. To assess the
quality of our framework, we use an open-access in-situ dataset and adopt
several competing classification approaches commonly considered for large-scale
land cover mapping. We evaluated all approaches through two scenarios: an
extrapolation scenario in which training data encompasses samples from all
biogeographical regions, and a leave-one-region-out scenario where one region
is excluded from training. We also explore the spatial representation learned
by our model, highlighting a connection between its internal manifold and the
geographical information used during training. Our results demonstrate that
integrating geospatial information improves land cover mapping performance,
with the most substantial gains achieved by jointly leveraging both fine- and
coarse-grained spatial information.

Conclusion: CLIP-Refine成功缓解模态间差距，同时保持零样本性能，无需高成本训练。

Abstract: Contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) is an essential component of
building modern vision-language foundation models. While CLIP demonstrates
remarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature
spaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text
feature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing
works attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or
fine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or
degradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a
post-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and
fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training
on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To
this end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and
hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features
to follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random
reference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid
soft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and
outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both
maintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features.
Our extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show
that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the
zero-shot performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域标注成本高，阻碍深度学习应用，因此需通过主动学习高效选择信息量大的数据。

Method: 引入主动学习，DNNs基于现有数据集识别新数据中信息量最大的帧，并评估不同测量方法，发现深度特征距离最有效。

Result: 实验表明，使用主动学习选择一半数据，DNNs在关键解剖和器械上的mIoU为0.4349，与完整数据集的0.4374几乎相当。

Conclusion: 主动学习能显著降低标注成本，提高DNNs性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Labeling has always been expensive in the medical context, which has hindered
related deep learning application. Our work introduces active learning in
surgical video frame selection to construct a high-quality, affordable
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy dataset for semantic segmentation. Active learning
allows the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learning pipeline to include the dataset
construction workflow, which means DNNs trained by existing dataset will
identify the most informative data from the newly collected data. At the same
time, DNNs' performance and generalization ability improve over time when the
newly selected and annotated data are included in the training data. We
assessed different data informativeness measurements and found the deep
features distances select the most informative data in this task. Our
experiments show that with half of the data selected by active learning, the
DNNs achieve almost the same performance with 0.4349 mean Intersection over
Union (mIoU) compared to the same DNNs trained on the full dataset (0.4374
mIoU) on the critical anatomies and surgical instruments.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出ANT框架，通过自动引导去噪轨迹实现文本到图像模型的伦理部署，防止有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法存在缺陷：anchor-free方法可能导致视觉伪像，anchor-based方法依赖启发式锚概念选择。

Method: ANT逆转classifier-free guidance的条件方向，使用trajectory-aware目标函数和增强权重显着性图进行精确概念擦除。

Result: 实验显示ANT在单多概念擦除中达到最先进性能，生成高质量、安全图像而不降低生成保真度。

Conclusion: ANT提供高效的即插即用解决方案，提升文本到图像模型的伦理部署，并开源代码。

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective
techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While
concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based
approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting
sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods
rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these
shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which
Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is
built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free
guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content
modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This
inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the
early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image
manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For
single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map
to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly
contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient
erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile
plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both
single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without
compromising the generative fidelity. Code is available at

Abstract: Pap smear image segmentation is crucial for cervical cancer diagnosis.
However, traditional segmentation models often struggle with complex cellular
structures and variations in pap smear images. This study proposes a hybrid
Dense-UNet201 optimization approach that integrates a pretrained DenseNet201 as
the encoder for the U-Net architecture and optimizes it using the spider monkey
optimization (SMO) algorithm. The Dense-UNet201 model excelled at feature
extraction. The SMO was modified to handle categorical and discrete parameters.
The SIPaKMeD dataset was used in this study and evaluated using key performance
metrics, including loss, accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice
coefficient. The experimental results showed that Dense-UNet201 outperformed
U-Net, Res-UNet50, and Efficient-UNetB0. SMO Dense-UNet201 achieved a
segmentation accuracy of 96.16%, an IoU of 91.63%, and a Dice coefficient score
of 95.63%. These findings underscore the effectiveness of image preprocessing,
pretrained models, and metaheuristic optimization in improving medical image
analysis and provide new insights into cervical cell segmentation methods.

Method: 引入在线强化学习框架，利用视觉提示和仅5张参考图像，在10个训练步骤内对扩散模型进行训练。

Result: 模型实现了复杂场景下的精确编辑，保持了无关区域的高保真度，并在机器人应用中提升了模拟环境的真实性。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了用户编辑过程，并证明了其在机器人学等领域的实用价值。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to training specialized instruction-based
image-editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in structural
preservation with input images and semantic alignment with user prompts. We
introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion
model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or
curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the realism and
alignment with instructions in two ways. First, the proposed models achieve
precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while
maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. Second, they capture
fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling
detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. This
approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring
only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental
results demonstrate that our models can perform intricate edits in complex
scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of
our method by applying it to robotics, where enhancing the visual realism of
simulated environments through targeted sim-to-real image edits improves their
utility as proxies for real-world settings.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种算法，通过分离CNN中多义通道的特征，提高神经网络的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN经常学习多义通道，这些通道编码多个不同概念，难以解释，因此需要改进可解释性。

Method: 提出算法通过重构权重，利用不同概念在上一层不同的激活模式来分离多义特征。

Result: 分离多义特征后，增强了CNN的可解释性，并改善了特征可视化等解释技术。

Conclusion: 最终提高了神经网络的解释性和决策机制的理解。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability is concerned with analyzing individual
components in a (convolutional) neural network (CNN) and how they form larger
circuits representing decision mechanisms. These investigations are challenging
since CNNs frequently learn polysemantic channels that encode distinct
concepts, making them hard to interpret. To address this, we propose an
algorithm to disentangle a specific kind of polysemantic channel into multiple
channels, each responding to a single concept. Our approach restructures
weights in a CNN, utilizing that different concepts within the same channel
exhibit distinct activation patterns in the previous layer. By disentangling
these polysemantic features, we enhance the interpretability of CNNs,
ultimately improving explanatory techniques such as feature visualizations.

TL;DR: 本文提出VLCA方法，使用语言空间作为桥梁连接视觉域，实现域泛化，通过对齐语义和视觉表示提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于图像域间差距，难以找到可靠的共同特征空间，而语言具有更全面的语义表达元素，因此提出使用语言作为桥梁。

Method: 在语言空间利用词向量距离捕获类别关系；在视觉空间通过低秩逼近探索共同模式；最终通过多模态空间对齐语言和视觉表示。

Result: 实验证明了所提出方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过语言语义桥接视觉域，改进了域泛化的性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization aims at training on source domains to uncover a
domain-invariant feature space, allowing the model to perform robust
generalization ability on unknown target domains. However, due to domain gaps,
it is hard to find reliable common image feature space, and the reason for that
is the lack of suitable basic units for images. Different from image in vision
space, language has comprehensive expression elements that can effectively
convey semantics. Inspired by the semantic completeness of language and
intuitiveness of image, we propose VLCA, which combine language space and
vision space, and connect the multiple image domains by using semantic space as
the bridge domain. Specifically, in language space, by taking advantage of the
completeness of language basic units, we tend to capture the semantic
representation of the relations between categories through word vector
distance. Then, in vision space, by taking advantage of the intuitiveness of
image features, the common pattern of sample features with the same class is
explored through low-rank approximation. In the end, the language
representation is aligned with the vision representation through the multimodal
space of text and image. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Result: 实验结果显示在六种模型和数据集组合上AUC值超过0.937，并验证了方法的转移性和实际应用。

Conclusion: 结论是ArtistAuditor有效，提供实际insights，并已开源。

Abstract: Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable
Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed
images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur
users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's
work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright
infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually
imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles
(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in
the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model
has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model
retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.
  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the
text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to
identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of
specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely,
ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style
representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then,
ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions.
The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that
ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying
ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights
into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario. ArtistAuditor

Abstract: We propose a method to transfer pose and expression between face images.
Given a source and target face portrait, the model produces an output image in
which the pose and expression of the source face image are transferred onto the
target identity. The architecture consists of two encoders and a mapping
network that projects the two inputs into the latent space of StyleGAN2, which
finally generates the output. The training is self-supervised from video
sequences of many individuals. Manual labeling is not required. Our model
enables the synthesis of random identities with controllable pose and
expression. Close-to-real-time performance is achieved.

Motivation: 在检索系统中，同时实现搜索准确性和效率具有挑战性，尤其在部分相关视频检索中，加入更多不同时间尺度的上下文表示可以提高准确性但会增加计算和内存成本。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet-Captions和QVHighlights数据集上进行广泛评估，证明了方法的有效性而不牺牲效率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了PRVR中的权衡问题，展示了在保持效率的同时提高准确性的潜力。

Abstract: In a retrieval system, simultaneously achieving search accuracy and
efficiency is inherently challenging. This challenge is particularly pronounced
in partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), where incorporating more diverse
context representations at varying temporal scales for each video enhances
accuracy but increases computational and memory costs. To address this
dichotomy, we propose a prototypical PRVR framework that encodes diverse
contexts within a video into a fixed number of prototypes. We then introduce
several strategies to enhance text association and video understanding within
the prototypes, along with an orthogonal objective to ensure that the
prototypes capture a diverse range of content. To keep the prototypes
searchable via text queries while accurately encoding video contexts, we
implement cross- and uni-modal reconstruction tasks. The cross-modal
reconstruction task aligns the prototypes with textual features within a shared
space, while the uni-modal reconstruction task preserves all video contexts
during encoding. Additionally, we employ a video mixing technique to provide
weak guidance to further align prototypes and associated textual
representations. Extensive evaluations on TVR, ActivityNet-Captions, and
QVHighlights validate the effectiveness of our approach without sacrificing
efficiency.

Result: 在视频幻觉、问答和字幕任务上显著提升性能，缓解视频语言不对齐问题。

Conclusion: VistaDPO 有效改善现有大型视频模型的表现。

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human
intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we
introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal
Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference
alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall
video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal
semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial
objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained
video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of
7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with
spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and
bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video
Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that
VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively
mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. The code and data are

Conclusion: 该方法证明事件信号能显著提升BVSR性能，提供更准确和高效的视频超分辨率解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of blurry video super-resolution (BVSR),
aiming to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) and
blurry inputs. Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high
resolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient
motion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in
LR frames. To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR
and propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR. To effectively fuse
information from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a
reciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from
intra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global
scene context from the frames to enhance event features. Furthermore, to
enhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module
that fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame
events and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable
alignment process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. Notably, on real data, our method is +2.59 dB more accurate and
7.28$\times$ faster than the recent best BVSR baseline FMA-Net. Code:

scientific comprehension and visual capabilities of pre-trained CLIP model.
Additionally, based on SciScore, we propose a two-stage training framework,
comprising a supervised fine-tuning phase and a masked online fine-tuning
phase, to incorporate scientific knowledge into existing generative models.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in establishing new standards for evaluating the scientific realism
of generated content. Specifically, SciScore attains performance comparable to

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many
high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and
training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation
from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark
results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without
knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific
progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a
Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for
transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard
training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore
large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in
detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M
human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and
spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce
PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks
focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a
video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes,
code & models.

Abstract: Computer vision is transforming fashion through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and
Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified
garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more
challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo
of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, on the other hand, extracts
standardized garment images from clothed individuals. We introduce TryOffDiff,
a diffusion-based VTOFF model. Built on a latent diffusion framework with
SigLIP image conditioning, it effectively captures garment properties like
texture, shape, and patterns. TryOffDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on
VITON-HD and strong performance on DressCode dataset, covering upper-body,
lower-body, and dresses. Enhanced with class-specific embeddings, it pioneers
multi-garment VTOFF, the first of its kind. When paired with VTON models, it
improves p2p-VTON by minimizing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin

Conclusion: 建立了评估人工智能创造力的理论基础和改进生成任务的实用指南。

Abstract: The ability to combine existing concepts into novel ideas stands as a
fundamental hallmark of human intelligence. Recent advances in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) like GPT-4V and DALLE-3 have sparked debate about whether their
outputs reflect combinational creativity--defined by M. A. Boden (1998) as
synthesizing novel ideas through combining existing concepts--or sophisticated
pattern matching of training data. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science,
we investigate the combinational creativity of VLMs from the lens of concept
blending. We propose the Identification-Explanation-Implication (IEI)
framework, which decomposes creative processes into three levels: identifying
input spaces, extracting shared attributes, and deriving novel semantic
implications. To validate this framework, we curate CreativeMashup, a
high-quality dataset of 666 artist-generated visual mashups annotated according
to the IEI framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in
comprehension tasks, best VLMs have surpassed average human performance while
falling short of expert-level understanding; in generation tasks, incorporating
our IEI framework into the generation pipeline significantly enhances the
creative quality of VLMs outputs. Our findings establish both a theoretical
foundation for evaluating artificial creativity and practical guidelines for
improving creative generation in VLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has
experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement
of textual capabilities in large language models. However, existing training
paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality
image-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the
availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce
and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.
This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for
vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale
low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a
viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)
achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language
models through empirical validation. This paper presents three key
contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,
low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO
methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,
the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2%
to 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals
that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their
counterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data
achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text
pairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support
in the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1
on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation
benchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and
knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.

TL;DR: 这篇论文引入Complex-Edit基准，用于评估图像编辑模型在复杂指令下的性能，并揭示模型弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是系统评估指令复杂性对图像编辑模型的影响，因为现有方法可能不足以覆盖多样性。

Method: 方法包括使用GPT-4o生成原子编辑任务，通过'Chain-of-Edit'管道整合指令，并开发指标和VLM-based自动评估管道。

Result: 结果显示开源模型落后于闭源模型，复杂度增加时性能差距扩大；复杂指令影响元素保留和美学；逐步执行降低性能；Best-of-N策略改善结果；观察到合成数据诅咒。

Conclusion: 结论是复杂指令暴露模型局限性，合成数据训练可能导致输出不真实，强调改进编辑模型的必要性。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{Complex-Edit}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate instruction-based image editing models across
instructions of varying complexity. To develop this benchmark, we harness
GPT-4o to automatically collect a diverse set of editing instructions at scale.
Our approach follows a well-structured ``Chain-of-Edit'' pipeline: we first
generate individual atomic editing tasks independently and then integrate them
to form cohesive, complex instructions. Additionally, we introduce a suite of
metrics to assess various aspects of editing performance, along with a
VLM-based auto-evaluation pipeline that supports large-scale assessments. Our
benchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly
underperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the
performance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased
instructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key
elements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality;
3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed
in a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple
metrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for
both direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe
a ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model
training, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly
synthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon
that intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TransST的转移学习框架，用于改进空间转录组数据的细胞水平异质性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组技术存在分辨率低和测序深度不足的问题，难以提取真实生物信号，因此需要新的方法来提升分析能力。

Method: 提出TransST框架，通过自适应利用外部细胞标记信息，推断目标空间转录组数据的细胞异质性。

Result: 在实际研究和模拟中，TransST显著优于现有方法，例如在乳腺癌研究中成功识别了五个细胞簇，并区分了脂肪组织和结缔组织。

Conclusion: TransST在识别细胞亚群和检测驱动生物标志物方面有效且稳健。

Abstract: Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in
biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts
and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest.
However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution
and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably
extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge,
we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to
adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in
inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.
  Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of
simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing
techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully
identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two
subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is
able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the
studied methods.
  Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and
robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving
biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了通过引入自适应兴奋-抑制平衡机制来提升水库计算机（RC）的性能，减少超参数调整需求，并在各种任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RC计算高效但对超参数敏感，且忽略了脑中兴奋-抑制平衡的重要性，本文旨在通过脑启发机制提高其鲁棒性和性能。

Method: 引入局部调整兴奋/抑制平衡的自适应机制，并添加神经元放电率的异质性，以减少超参数微调。

Result: RC在平衡或轻微过抑制状态下表现最佳，自适应机制使性能提高高达130%，并在线性与非线性任务中优于传统RC。

Conclusion: 支持水库设计从静态优化转向动态适应，增强了对神经计算的理解和RC的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reservoir computers (RCs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to
deep learning while also offering a framework for incorporating brain-inspired
computational principles. By using an internal neural network with random,
fixed connections$-$the 'reservoir'$-$and training only the output weights, RCs
simplify the training process but remain sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters that govern activation functions and network architecture.
Moreover, typical RC implementations overlook a critical aspect of neuronal
dynamics: the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals, which is
essential for robust brain function. We show that RCs characteristically
perform best in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, outperforming
excitation-dominated ones. To reduce the need for precise hyperparameter
tuning, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E/I balance
to achieve target neuronal firing rates, improving performance by up to 130% in
tasks like memory capacity and time series prediction compared with globally
tuned RCs. Incorporating brain-inspired heterogeneity in target neuronal firing
rates further reduces the need for fine-tuning hyperparameters and enables RCs
to excel across linear and non-linear tasks. These results support a shift from
static optimization to dynamic adaptation in reservoir design, demonstrating
how brain-inspired mechanisms improve RC performance and robustness while
deepening our understanding of neural computation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in emotional expression of existing TTS models, enabling more natural and human-like speech synthesis.

Method: Proposes EmoVoice model with LLM-based emotion control and parallel phoneme-audio output design, and introduces EmoVoice-DB dataset with fine-grained emotion labels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on English and Chinese test sets, and explores emotion evaluation metrics using multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: Advances TTS technology by providing an effective emotion control mechanism and open resources for future research.

Abstract: Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound
exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech
(TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling
the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose
EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language
models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion
control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme
tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by
chain-of-thought (CoT) and modality-of-thought (CoM) techniques. Besides, we
introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring
expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language
descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English
EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese
Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability
of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human
perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and
Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EmoVoice-DF55. Dataset, code, and checkpoints

Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) is of great significance for
the protection of marine diversity and national defense security. The
development of deep learning provides new opportunities for UATR, but faces
challenges brought by the scarcity of reference samples and complex
environmental interference. To address these issues, we proposes a multi-task
balanced channel attention convolutional neural network (MT-BCA-CNN). The
method integrates a channel attention mechanism with a multi-task learning
strategy, constructing a shared feature extractor and multi-task classifiers to
jointly optimize target classification and feature reconstruction tasks. The
channel attention mechanism dynamically enhances discriminative acoustic
features such as harmonic structures while suppressing noise. Experiments on
the Watkins Marine Life Dataset demonstrate that MT-BCA-CNN achieves 97\%
classification accuracy and 95\% $F1$-score in 27-class few-shot scenarios,
significantly outperforming traditional CNN and ACNN models, as well as popular
state-of-the-art UATR methods. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic
benefits of multi-task learning and attention mechanisms, while a dynamic
weighting adjustment strategy effectively balances task contributions. This
work provides an efficient solution for few-shot underwater acoustic
recognition, advancing research in marine bioacoustics and sonar signal
processing.

Abstract: We propose a new theory for aging based on dynamical systems and provide a
data-driven computational method to quantify the changes at the cellular level.
We use ergodic theory to decompose the dynamics of changes during aging and
show that aging is fundamentally a dissipative process within biological
systems, akin to dynamical systems where dissipation occurs due to
non-conservative forces. To quantify the dissipation dynamics, we employ a
transformer-based machine learning algorithm to analyze gene expression data,
incorporating age as a token to assess how age-related dissipation is reflected
in the embedding space. By evaluating the dynamics of gene and age embeddings,
we provide a cellular aging map (CAM) and identify patterns indicative of
divergence in gene embedding space, nonlinear transitions, and entropy
variations during aging for various tissues and cell types. Our results provide
a novel perspective on aging as a dissipative process and introduce a
computational framework that enables measuring age-related changes with
molecular resolution.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in scientific domains, especially
for molecular understanding and analysis. However, existing models are affected
by hallucination issues, resulting in errors in drug design and utilization. In
this paper, we first analyze the sources of hallucination in LLMs for molecular
comprehension tasks, specifically the knowledge shortcut phenomenon observed in
the PubChem dataset. To evaluate hallucination in molecular comprehension tasks
with computational efficiency, we introduce \textbf{Mol-Hallu}, a novel
free-form evaluation metric that quantifies the degree of hallucination based
on the scientific entailment relationship between generated text and actual
molecular properties. Utilizing the Mol-Hallu metric, we reassess and analyze
the extent of hallucination in various LLMs performing molecular comprehension
tasks. Furthermore, the Hallucination Reduction Post-processing stage~(HRPP) is
proposed to alleviate molecular hallucinations, Experiments show the
effectiveness of HRPP on decoder-only and encoder-decoder molecular LLMs. Our
findings provide critical insights into mitigating hallucination and improving
the reliability of LLMs in scientific applications.

Abstract: With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous

also provide exclusive benchmarks utilized in our experiments to show how to
properly verify understanding capabilities across different modalities. Results
show that by following our guidance, we can efficiently build an MLLM that
achieves competitive performance among models of the same scale on various
multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, to enhance the multimodal instruction
following and conversational capabilities of the model, we further discuss how
to train the chat version upon an MLLM understanding model, which is more in
line with user habits for tasks like real-time interaction with humans. We

TL;DR: This study assesses creativity in 14 LLMs using DAT and AUT tasks, finding no improvement over time, high output variability, and the need for better evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs have become more creative and consistent in their outputs since ChatGPT's adoption in 2023.

Method: Evaluated 14 LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) on the Divergent Association Task (DAT) and Alternative Uses Task (AUT).

Result: No evidence of increased creativity over 18-24 months; GPT-4 performed worse than before; most models outperformed average humans in AUT, but only 0.28% of responses reached top human benchmarks; high intra-model variability observed.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for nuanced evaluation frameworks, emphasizing model selection, prompt design, and repeated assessments for using GenAI in creative contexts.

Abstract: Following the widespread adoption of ChatGPT in early 2023, numerous studies
reported that large language models (LLMs) can match or even surpass human
performance in creative tasks. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs have
become more creative over time, and how consistent their creative output is. In
this study, we evaluated 14 widely used LLMs -- including GPT-4, Claude, Llama,
Grok, Mistral, and DeepSeek -- across two validated creativity assessments: the
Divergent Association Task (DAT) and the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Contrary
to expectations, we found no evidence of increased creative performance over
the past 18-24 months, with GPT-4 performing worse than in previous studies.
For the more widely used AUT, all models performed on average better than the
average human, with GPT-4o and o3-mini performing best. However, only 0.28% of
LLM-generated responses reached the top 10% of human creativity benchmarks.
Beyond inter-model differences, we document substantial intra-model
variability: the same LLM, given the same prompt, can produce outputs ranging
from below-average to original. This variability has important implications for
both creativity research and practical applications. Ignoring such variability
risks misjudging the creative potential of LLMs, either inflating or
underestimating their capabilities. The choice of prompts affected LLMs
differently. Our findings underscore the need for more nuanced evaluation
frameworks and highlight the importance of model selection, prompt design, and
repeated assessment when using Generative AI (GenAI) tools in creative
contexts.

Result: AttentionDefense的检测性能与现有方法相当或更好，对新越狱攻击具有鲁棒性，且计算需求低。

Conclusion: 注意力机制是理解语言模型对恶意输入响应的关键，AttentionDefense是一种理想的实用防御方案。

Abstract: In the past few years, Language Models (LMs) have shown par-human
capabilities in several domains. Despite their practical applications and
exceeding user consumption, they are susceptible to jailbreaks when malicious
input exploits the LM's weaknesses, causing it to deviate from its intended
behavior. Current defensive strategies either classify the input prompt as
adversarial or prevent LMs from generating harmful outputs. However, it is
challenging to explain the reason behind the malicious nature of the jailbreak,
which results in a wide variety of closed-box approaches. In this research, we
propose and demonstrate that system-prompt attention from Small Language Models
(SLMs) can be used to characterize adversarial prompts, providing a novel,
explainable, and cheaper defense approach called AttentionDefense. Our research
suggests that the attention mechanism is an integral component in understanding
and explaining how LMs respond to malicious input that is not captured in the
semantic meaning of text embeddings. The proposed AttentionDefense is evaluated
against existing jailbreak benchmark datasets. Ablation studies show that
SLM-based AttentionDefense has equivalent or better jailbreak detection
performance compared to text embedding-based classifiers and GPT-4 zero-shot
detectors.To further validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we
generate a dataset of novel jailbreak variants of the existing benchmark
dataset using a closed-loop LLM-based multi-agent system. We demonstrate that
the proposed AttentionDefense approach performs robustly on this novel
jailbreak dataset while existing approaches suffer in performance.
Additionally, for practical purposes AttentionDefense is an ideal solution as
it has the computation requirements of a small LM but the performance of a LLM
detector.

Conclusion: 挑战大型模型必要性，主张小型LLM协调策略；数据集、模型和代码已公开。

Abstract: While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance
small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models
(LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency,
and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast,
smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual
capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable
data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose
a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized
roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically
achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small
LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a
peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial
data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the
Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the
synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can
achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through
experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data
matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g.,
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large
models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic
coordination of smaller agents. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly
available at https://github.com/GX-XinGao/GRA.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant document from external knowledge sources. By referencing
this external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the generation of factually
incorrect content and addresses hallucination issues within LLMs. Recently,
there has been growing attention to improving the performance and efficiency of
RAG systems from various perspectives. While these advancements have yielded
significant results, the application of RAG in domains with considerable
societal implications raises a critical question about fairness: What impact
does the introduction of the RAG paradigm have on the fairness of LLMs? To
address this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs,
retrievers, and retrieval sources. Our experimental analysis reveals that the
scale of the LLMs plays a significant role in influencing fairness outcomes
within the RAG framework. When the model scale is smaller than 8B, the
integration of retrieval mechanisms often exacerbates unfairness in small-scale
LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA3-8B). To mitigate the fairness
issues introduced by RAG for small-scale LLMs, we propose two approaches,
FairFT and FairFilter. Specifically, in FairFT, we align the retriever with the
LLM in terms of fairness, enabling it to retrieve documents that facilitate
fairer model outputs. In FairFilter, we propose a fairness filtering mechanism
to filter out biased content after retrieval. Finally, we validate our proposed
approaches on real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in
improving fairness while maintaining performance.

Motivation: 尽管NLI任务有多种子方向，但跨文档跨语言NLI（CDCL-NLI）尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出整合RST增强图融合的RGAT方法和基于词汇链的语义对齐机制，以及EDU-level归因框架。

Conclusion: 这项工作启发NLI研究，促进行业对跨文档跨语言理解、语义检索和可解释性推理的关注，并公开数据集和代码。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamental task in both natural
language processing and information retrieval. While NLI has developed many
sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual
NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for CDCL-NLI that extends traditional
NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this
task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 1,110 instances
and spanning 26 languages. To build a baseline for this task, we also propose
an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion and
interpretability prediction. Our method employs RST (Rhetorical Structure
Theory) on RGAT (Relation-aware Graph Attention Network) for cross-document
context modeling, coupled with a structure-aware semantic alignment mechanism
based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI
interpretability, we develop an EDU-level attribution framework that generates
extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's
superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both traditional
NLI models such as DocNLI and R2F, as well as LLMs like Llama3 and GPT-4o. Our
work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on
cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, semantic retrieval and
interpretability inference. Our dataset and code are available at

Motivation: 社交媒体内容急剧增加，分析在线话语变得复杂，需要自动分类法帮助利益相关者导航。

Method: 使用不同LLM模型在三个数据集上实现框架，生成多层次粒度主题，并引入专用评估指标。

Result: LLMTaxo有效分类事实声明，某些模型在特定数据集上表现更好，经人类和GPT-4评估确认。

Conclusion: LLMTaxo框架是社交媒体事实声明分类的有效工具。

Abstract: With the vast expansion of content on social media platforms, analyzing and
comprehending online discourse has become increasingly complex. This paper
introduces LLMTaxo, a novel framework leveraging large language models for the
automated construction of taxonomy of factual claims from social media by
generating topics from multi-level granularities. This approach aids
stakeholders in more effectively navigating the social media landscapes. We
implement this framework with different models across three distinct datasets
and introduce specially designed taxonomy evaluation metrics for a
comprehensive assessment. With the evaluations from both human evaluators and
GPT-4, the results indicate that LLMTaxo effectively categorizes factual claims
from social media, and reveals that certain models perform better on specific
datasets.

Motivation: 临床病例报告完整但延迟，结构化数据虽早但不完整，需要更完整和时间精细的数据训练模型。

Method: 开发了一个使用LLM的管道来表型化、提取和标注病例报告中的时间定位发现，并应用于PubMed Open Access子集生成脓毒症-3语料库，与专家标注比较。

Conclusion: 证明了LLM在文本中时间定位临床发现的能力，突出了其局限性和通过多模态整合的改进潜力。

Abstract: Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and
accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e.,
timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become
available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms
on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to
phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports
using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access
textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the
Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA
and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to
physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings
(event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and
strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize
clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal
reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via
multimodal integration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有方法训练成本高和输出冗长低效的问题，开发一种训练-free框架来提升模型推理性能。

Method: 基于观察推理支持tokens（如'wait'）和模型控制，战略性将反思步骤委托给大模型，实现推理水平的指导。

Result: 1.5B模型在MATH500基准上准确率从83.2%提升至89.4%，输出长度减少15.7%；Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct准确率从74.0%提升至81.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了推理模型的准确性和效率，证明了其在提升性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances leverage post-training to enhance model reasoning
performance, which typically requires costly training pipelines and still
suffers from inefficient, overly lengthy outputs. We introduce Speculative
Thinking, a training-free framework that enables large reasoning models to
guide smaller ones during inference at the reasoning level, distinct from
speculative decoding, which operates at the token level. Our approach is based
on two observations: (1) reasoning-supportive tokens such as "wait" frequently
appear after structural delimiters like "\n\n", serving as signals for
reflection or continuation; and (2) larger models exhibit stronger control over
reflective behavior, reducing unnecessary backtracking while improving
reasoning quality. By strategically delegating reflective steps to a more
capable model, our method significantly boosts the reasoning accuracy of
reasoning models while shortening their output. With the assistance of the 32B
reasoning model, the 1.5B model's accuracy on MATH500 increases from 83.2% to
89.4%, marking a substantial improvement of 6.2%. Simultaneously, the average
output length is reduced from 5439 tokens to 4583 tokens, representing a 15.7%
decrease. Moreover, when applied to a non-reasoning model
(Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct), our framework boosts its accuracy from 74.0% to 81.8%
on the same benchmark, achieving a relative improvement of 7.8%.

Motivation: 传统单代理 RAG 在处理需要跨异构数据生态协调推理的复杂查询时存在局限性。

Method: 框架采用三层架构，包括分解代理（处理查询分解）、多源检索代理（并行模态特定检索）和决策代理（整合答案并解决不一致）。

Result: 在 ScienceQA 和 CrisisMMD 基准上，答案准确率提升 12.95%，问题分类准确率提升 3.56%，并在零样本设置中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: HM-RAG 在多模态推理和知识合成方面取得进展，具有模块化设计，便于集成新模态并确保数据治理。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models
(LLMs) with external knowledge, conventional single-agent RAG remains
fundamentally limited in resolving complex queries demanding coordinated
reasoning across heterogeneous data ecosystems. We present HM-RAG, a novel
Hierarchical Multi-agent Multimodal RAG framework that pioneers collaborative
intelligence for dynamic knowledge synthesis across structured, unstructured,
and graph-based data. The framework is composed of three-tiered architecture
with specialized agents: a Decomposition Agent that dissects complex queries
into contextually coherent sub-tasks via semantic-aware query rewriting and
schema-guided context augmentation; Multi-source Retrieval Agents that carry
out parallel, modality-specific retrieval using plug-and-play modules designed
for vector, graph, and web-based databases; and a Decision Agent that uses
consistency voting to integrate multi-source answers and resolve discrepancies
in retrieval results through Expert Model Refinement. This architecture attains
comprehensive query understanding by combining textual, graph-relational, and
web-derived evidence, resulting in a remarkable 12.95% improvement in answer
accuracy and a 3.56% boost in question classification accuracy over baseline
RAG systems on the ScienceQA and CrisisMMD benchmarks. Notably, HM-RAG
establishes state-of-the-art results in zero-shot settings on both datasets.
Its modular architecture ensures seamless integration of new data modalities
while maintaining strict data governance, marking a significant advancement in
addressing the critical challenges of multimodal reasoning and knowledge
synthesis in RAG systems. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理冗余信息和隐式情感类别时存在挑战，本研究旨在通过细粒度方法克服这些问题。

Method: 使用指令调优、低秩适配微调大语言模型，并通过提示-based数据增强生成合成数据。

Result: 实验显示比基线方法至少提高了12.8%的性能指标。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且鲁棒，为情感原因分析研究提供了新方向，代码开源。

Abstract: Span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction represents a novel and
complex challenge within emotion cause analysis. This task involves identifying
emotion spans, cause spans, and their associated emotion categories within the
text to form structured triplets. While prior research has predominantly
concentrated on clause-level emotion-cause pair extraction and span-level
emotion-cause detection, these methods often confront challenges originating
from redundant information retrieval and difficulty in accurately determining
emotion categories, particularly when emotions are expressed implicitly or
ambiguously. To overcome these challenges, this study explores a fine-grained
approach to span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction and introduces
an innovative framework that leverages instruction tuning and data augmentation
techniques based on large language models. The proposed method employs
task-specific triplet extraction instructions and utilizes low-rank adaptation
to fine-tune large language models, eliminating the necessity for intricate
task-specific architectures. Furthermore, a prompt-based data augmentation
strategy is developed to address data scarcity by guiding large language models
in generating high-quality synthetic training data. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing baseline methods, achieving at least a 12.8% improvement in span-level
emotion-cause-category triplet extraction metrics. The results demonstrate the
method's effectiveness and robustness, offering a promising avenue for
advancing research in emotion cause analysis. The source code is available at

Motivation: 针对LLM在主观评估中的准确性和一致性不确定性，特别是小型本地模型。

Method: 使用二元分类指标（如准确率、真正正例率、真正负例率）比较五种LLM在En-join游戏中的表现。

Result: 模型存在敏感性、特异性和性能权衡，有些擅长正确响应识别，但可能有假阳性问题。

Conclusion: 需要上下文感知框架和谨慎模型选择，为AI评估工具可靠性提供洞见。

Abstract: The evaluation of open-ended responses in serious games presents a unique
challenge, as correctness is often subjective. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly being explored as evaluators in such contexts, yet their accuracy
and consistency remain uncertain, particularly for smaller models intended for
local execution. This study investigates the reliability of five small-scale
LLMs when assessing player responses in \textit{En-join}, a game that simulates
decision-making within energy communities. By leveraging traditional binary
classification metrics (including accuracy, true positive rate, and true
negative rate), we systematically compare these models across different
evaluation scenarios. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of
each model, revealing trade-offs between sensitivity, specificity, and overall
performance. We demonstrate that while some models excel at identifying correct
responses, others struggle with false positives or inconsistent evaluations.
The findings highlight the need for context-aware evaluation frameworks and
careful model selection when deploying LLMs as evaluators. This work
contributes to the broader discourse on the trustworthiness of AI-driven
assessment tools, offering insights into how different LLM architectures handle
subjective evaluation tasks.

Motivation: LLM 通过 API 提供服务，开发人员难以检测其行为变化，因此需要一种简单有效的监控方法。

Method: 使用统计测试比较两个文本样本的特征分布，以确定 LLM 是否发生变化。

Result: 在 OpenAI 的五个完成模型和 Meta 的 Llama 3 70B 聊天模型上验证了方法的有效性，能区分模型并检测提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了频繁的 LLM 变化监控，并避免了计算密集型基准评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often provided as a service via an API,
making it challenging for developers to detect changes in their behavior. We
present an approach to monitor LLMs for changes by comparing the distributions
of linguistic and psycholinguistic features of generated text. Our method uses
a statistical test to determine whether the distributions of features from two
samples of text are equivalent, allowing developers to identify when an LLM has
changed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five OpenAI
completion models and Meta's Llama 3 70B chat model. Our results show that
simple text features coupled with a statistical test can distinguish between
language models. We also explore the use of our approach to detect prompt
injection attacks. Our work enables frequent LLM change monitoring and avoids
computationally expensive benchmark evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床事件时间信息对患者轨迹分析至关重要，但结构化电子健康记录缺少关键数据，临床报告缺乏结构化时间定位。

Method: 对比手动和LLM标注（样本量分别为320和390），在随机抽样的PubMed开放获取病例报告上评估事件召回和时间一致性。

Result: LLM模型事件召回中等（0.80），时间一致性高（0.95）。

Conclusion: 此工作可作为利用PMOA语料库进行时间分析的基准。

Abstract: Timing of clinical events is central to characterization of patient
trajectories, enabling analyses such as process tracing, forecasting, and
causal reasoning. However, structured electronic health records capture few
data elements critical to these tasks, while clinical reports lack temporal
localization of events in structured form. We present a system that transforms
case reports into textual time series-structured pairs of textual events and
timestamps. We contrast manual and large language model (LLM) annotations
(n=320 and n=390 respectively) of ten randomly-sampled PubMed open-access
(PMOA) case reports (N=152,974) and assess inter-LLM agreement (n=3,103; N=93).
We find that the LLM models have moderate event recall(O1-preview: 0.80) but
high temporal concordance among identified events (O1-preview: 0.95). By
establishing the task, annotation, and assessment systems, and by demonstrating
high concordance, this work may serve as a benchmark for leveraging the PMOA
corpus for temporal analytics.

Motivation: 强调LLM训练中人类劳动成本被忽视，尽管计算、硬件和能源需求不断增加。

Method: 研究2016-2024年64个LLM，估计从零开始支付人类生产训练数据集的成本。

Result: 保守估计下，训练数据集成本是模型训练成本的10-1000倍，构成LLM提供者的重大财务责任。

Conclusion: 突出训练数据价值与补偿缺失的巨大差距，并讨论未来公平实践的研究方向。

Abstract: Training a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) is an increasingly
expensive endeavor due to growing computational, hardware, energy, and
engineering demands. Yet, an often-overlooked (and seldom paid) expense is the
human labor behind these models' training data. Every LLM is built on an
unfathomable amount of human effort: trillions of carefully written words
sourced from books, academic papers, codebases, social media, and more. This
position paper aims to assign a monetary value to this labor and argues that
the most expensive part of producing an LLM should be the compensation provided
to training data producers for their work. To support this position, we study
64 LLMs released between 2016 and 2024, estimating what it would cost to pay
people to produce their training datasets from scratch. Even under highly
conservative estimates of wage rates, the costs of these models' training
datasets are 10-1000 times larger than the costs to train the models
themselves, representing a significant financial liability for LLM providers.
In the face of the massive gap between the value of training data and the lack
of compensation for its creation, we highlight and discuss research directions
that could enable fairer practices in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练数据对语言模型表示的影响，特别是线性表示，因为现有研究主要关注下游任务行为。

Method: 通过分析预训练术语频率与线性表示的关联，使用OLMo-7B和GPT-J模型，并训练回归模型预测术语频率。

Result: 发现主语和宾语共现频率分别至少1k和2k时，线性表示形成；回归模型在不同模型上预测准确。

Conclusion: 线性表示强度反映预训练语料信息，可通过操纵数据频率控制模型行为。

Abstract: Pretraining data has a direct impact on the behaviors and quality of language
models (LMs), but we only understand the most basic principles of this
relationship. While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on
downstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM
representations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some
concepts are encoded `linearly' in the representations, but what factors cause
these representations to form? We study the connection between pretraining data
frequency and models' linear representations of factual relations. We find
evidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to
pretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact
triplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning
accuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations.
This is the case across all phases of pretraining. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J, we
discover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms
when the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k
times, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during
pretraining. Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear
representation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term
was seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a
different model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method
for estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data
models. We conclude that the strength of linear representations in LMs contains
signal about the models' pretraining corpora that may provide new avenues for
controlling and improving model behavior: particularly, manipulating the
models' training data to meet specific frequency thresholds.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，BiGTex在节点分类中达到最先进性能，并泛化到链接预测；消融研究强调了软提示和双向注意力的重要性。

Conclusion: BiGTex有效整合GNN和LLM，提高了文本属性图表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation
learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of
node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph
neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the
capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs)
are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph
structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel
architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text
Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and
structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions,
text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The
proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA),
keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves
state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively
to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft
prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.

Motivation: 偏好调整技术（如RLHF、PPO、GRPO、DPO）减少模型多样性，在需要多样输出的应用中形成难题。

Result: 偏好调整模型减少词汇和句法多样性，但增加有效语义多样性；较小模型更参数高效。

Conclusion: 这些发现对需要多样高质量输出的应用有启示，并区分了形式和内容多样性。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that preference-tuning techniques--including
Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences (RLHF) methods like PPO and GRPO,
as well as alternatives like DPO--reduce diversity, creating a dilemma given
that such models are widely deployed in applications requiring diverse outputs.
To address this, we introduce a framework for measuring effective semantic
diversity--diversity among outputs that meet quality thresholds--which better
reflects the practical utility of large language models (LLMs). Using
open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive
results: although preference-tuned models--especially those trained via
RL--exhibit reduced lexical and syntactic diversity, they produce greater
effective semantic diversity than SFT or base models, not from increasing
diversity among high-quality outputs, but from generating more high-quality
outputs overall. We discover that preference tuning reduces syntactic diversity
while preserving semantic diversity--revealing a distinction between diversity
in form and diversity in content that traditional metrics often overlook. Our
analysis further shows that smaller models are consistently more
parameter-efficient at generating unique content within a fixed sampling
budget, offering insights into the relationship between model scaling and
diversity. These findings have important implications for applications that
require diverse yet high-quality outputs, from creative assistance to synthetic
data generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注实体替换，无法捕捉复杂现实动态，因此需要更全面的知识更新框架。

Method: 提出KUP管道模拟知识更新，并使用MCT训练，通过条件化更新语料的标记来提升记忆和推理。

Result: KUP基准挑战性高，最好模型间接探测成绩不足2%；MCT比基线提高多达25.4%的直接探测结果。

Conclusion: 证明KUP难度大，MCT有效，强调知识更新中记忆和推理的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of pre-trained knowledge in
their parameters, but updating them as real-world information evolves remains a
challenge. Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity
substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an
automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an
evidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect
probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for
any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called
memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus
on self-generated "memory" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs
to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results
on two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the
best CPT models achieving $<2\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and
(2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT)
baselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\%$.

Method: 方法包括使用prefix-prompting在Llama 3 70B模型上进行自回归重构，并分析权重变化。

Result: 结果显示某些书籍可高相似度重构，提取率与书籍流行度相关，缓解策略可被逆转，主要由少量权重控制。

Conclusion: 结论是当前缓解策略有限，并提供了一个框架来研究微调对记忆的影响。

Abstract: To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B
family of models, and the "prefix-prompting" extraction technique, we were able
to auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one
entire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens.
We were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books,
piece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We
show that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus,
likely duplication in the training data.
  We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama
3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this
undoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated
primarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the
limits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework
for studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in
aligned LLMs.

Conclusion: 少量多样化合成数据无需真实数据即可有效实现领域适应。

Abstract: Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data
generated using larger Language models. Questions remain about leveraging
synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains.
A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts
its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we
propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances
diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple
"expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million
tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a
well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and
Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in
general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data
using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM
pre-training corpora.
  Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms
the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in
Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data
generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior
generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest
that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real
data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.

Motivation: 动机是解决LLMs由于学到的隐式先验分布影响，导致在计数或缩写等任务中响应不当的问题。

Result: 结果显示提示能显著改善性能，识别出与先验相关的层，微调后在保留任务上表现高，且错误不再与先验相关。

Conclusion: 结论表明LLMs中包含正确响应信息，可能通过操纵先验依赖来减少幻觉，提高性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) sometimes fail to respond appropriately to
deterministic tasks -- such as counting or forming acronyms -- because the
implicit prior distribution they have learned over sequences of tokens
influences their responses. In this work, we show that, in at least some cases,
LLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly,
and we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this
information to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting
the language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic
improvements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability
techniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to
which that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is
possible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate
with the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of
these layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high
performance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information
required to produce a correct response is contained within the representations
of the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning
is significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error
after finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest
that it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent
to which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially
increasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons
related to the prior probability of token sequences.

Motivation: 现有的医疗预测模型未能利用非结构化临床笔记中的信息，本研究旨在通过整合大语言模型来提取和利用这些数据。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据集中的14,011例首次入院数据，构建框架，将GPT响应作为logistic回归模型的输入特征，并与标准表格数据模型比较。

Result: GPT-based模型优于标准表格数据模型，结合两种数据源后，AUC平均提高5.1个百分点，最高风险十分位数的阳性预测值提高29.9%。

Conclusion: 突显了将大语言模型整合到临床预测任务中的价值，并强调了在其他利用非结构化文本数据的领域中的潜在应用。

Abstract: There is a long history of building predictive models in healthcare using
tabular data from electronic medical records. However, these models fail to
extract the information found in unstructured clinical notes, which document
diagnosis, treatment, progress, medications, and care plans. In this study, we
investigate how answers generated by GPT-4o-mini (ChatGPT) to simple clinical
questions about patients, when given access to the patient's discharge summary,
can support patient-level mortality prediction. Using data from 14,011
first-time admissions to the Coronary Care or Cardiovascular Intensive Care
Units in the MIMIC-IV Note dataset, we implement a transparent framework that
uses GPT responses as input features in logistic regression models. Our
findings demonstrate that GPT-based models alone can outperform models trained
on standard tabular data, and that combining both sources of information yields
even greater predictive power, increasing AUC by an average of 5.1 percentage
points and increasing positive predictive value by 29.9 percent for the
highest-risk decile. These results highlight the value of integrating large
language models (LLMs) into clinical prediction tasks and underscore the
broader potential for using LLMs in any domain where unstructured text data
remains an underutilized resource.

Result: 模型在RULER和InfiniteBench基准上表现良好，并保持一般语言任务性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了长上下文数据稀缺问题，提高了LLM的长上下文能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with long-context reasoning, not only
due to the quadratic scaling of computational complexity with sequence length
but also because of the scarcity and expense of annotating long-context data.
There has been barely any open-source work that systematically ablates
long-context data, nor is there any openly available instruction tuning dataset
with contexts surpassing 100K tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
post-training synthetic data generation strategy designed to efficiently extend
the context window of LLMs while preserving their general task performance. Our
approach scalably extends to arbitrarily long context lengths, unconstrained by
the length of available real-world data, which effectively addresses the
scarcity of raw long-context data. Through a step-by-step rotary position
embedding (RoPE) scaling training strategy, we demonstrate that our model, with
a context length of up to 1M tokens, performs well on the RULER benchmark and
InfiniteBench and maintains robust performance on general language tasks.

Result: 实验结果显示，Persona-judge提供可扩展、计算高效的个性化对齐解决方案。

Conclusion: 这为更具适应性的定制对齐铺平道路。

Abstract: Aligning language models with human preferences presents significant
challenges, particularly in achieving personalization without incurring
excessive computational costs. Existing methods rely on reward signals and
additional annotated data, limiting their scalability and adaptability to
diverse human values. To address these challenges, we introduce Persona-judge,
a novel discriminative paradigm that enables training-free personalized
alignment with unseen preferences. Instead of optimizing policy parameters
through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic
preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model
generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge
model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens
whether to be accepted. Experimental results demonstrate that Persona-judge,
using the inherent preference evaluation mechanisms of the model, offers a
scalable and computationally efficient solution to personalized alignment,
paving the way for more adaptive customized alignment.

Motivation: 检索文档中存在无关或误导信息，导致摘要压缩遗漏关键信息，尤其在长上下文中注意力分散。

Method: 提出ACoRN，包括离线数据增强提高对检索噪声的鲁棒性，以及微调生成以直接支持答案的关键信息摘要。

Result: 实验表明，使用ACoRN训练的T5-large改善了EM和F1分数，保留答案字符串，在噪声文档多的数据集上表现优秀。

Conclusion: ACoRN在真实场景中非常有用，可提升RAG的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Abstractive compression utilizes smaller langauge models to condense
query-relevant context, reducing computational costs in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). However,retrieved documents often include information that is
either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect
content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that
abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential
for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion
occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more
fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise
(ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data
augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against
two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language modelbased
compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents
and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries
centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our
experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor,
improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve
as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy-reducing
documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 大语言模型学习敏感信息引发隐私和法律问题，重新训练成本高，现有的单域方法无法处理多域知识交织问题。

Method: 提出GRAIL框架，利用梯度信息区分删除和保留范围，并采用自适应参数定位策略选择性地移除目标知识。

Result: 实验结果显示，GRAIL的删除成功率与现有方法相当，但知识保留成功率提高17%。

Conclusion: 建立了管理大语言模型敏感信息的新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive datasets often learn
sensitive information, which raises significant social and legal concerns under
principles such as the "Right to be forgotten." Retraining entire models from
scratch to remove undesired information is both costly and impractical.
Furthermore, existing single-domain unlearning methods fail to address
multi-domain scenarios, where knowledge is interwoven across domains such as
privacy and copyright, creating overlapping representations that lead to
excessive knowledge removal or degraded performance. To tackle these issues, we
propose GRAIL (GRadient-based AdaptIve unLearning), a novel multi-domain
unlearning framework. GRAIL leverages gradient information from multiple
domains to precisely distinguish the unlearning scope from the retention scope,
and applies an adaptive parameter-wise localization strategy to selectively
remove targeted knowledge while preserving critical parameters for each domain.
Experimental results on unlearning benchmarks show that GRAIL achieves
unlearning success on par with the existing approaches, while also
demonstrating up to 17% stronger knowledge retention success compared to the
previous state-of-art method. Our findings establish a new paradigm for
effectively managing and regulating sensitive information in large-scale
pre-trained language models.

Result: 在四个基准上涉及三个SKR任务中，Pandora优于现有统一框架，并与任务特定方法竞争。

Conclusion: Pandora框架证明了统一知识表示和LLM对齐的有效性，提升了USKR性能。

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and
knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on
employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which
struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or
align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper
proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage
of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge
representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to
generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question.
Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various
SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora}
outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with
task-specific methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in general domains and demonstrated promise in multimodal
mathematical reasoning. However, applying MLLMs to geometry problem solving
(GPS) remains challenging due to lack of accurate step-by-step solution data
and severe hallucinations during reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoGen, a
pipeline that can automatically generates step-wise reasoning paths for
geometry diagrams. By leveraging the precise symbolic reasoning,
\textbf{GeoGen} produces large-scale, high-quality question-answer pairs. To
further enhance the logical reasoning ability of MLLMs, we train
\textbf{GeoLogic}, a Large Language Model (LLM) using synthetic data generated
by GeoGen. Serving as a bridge between natural language and symbolic systems,
GeoLogic enables symbolic tools to help verifying MLLM outputs, making the
reasoning process more rigorous and alleviating hallucinations. Experimental
results show that our approach consistently improves the performance of MLLMs,
achieving remarkable results on benchmarks for geometric reasoning tasks. This
improvement stems from our integration of the strengths of LLMs and symbolic
systems, which enables a more reliable and interpretable approach for the GPS
task. Codes are available at https://github.com/ycpNotFound/GeoGen.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced AI agents
as a disruptive paradigm across various industries, yet their application in
machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper describes and
analyses the potential of single- and multi-agent systems for MT, reflecting on
how they could enhance multilingual digital communication. While single-agent
systems are well-suited for simpler translation tasks, multi-agent systems,
which involve multiple specialized AI agents collaborating in a structured
manner, may offer a promising solution for complex scenarios requiring high
accuracy, domain-specific knowledge, and contextual awareness. To demonstrate
the feasibility of multi-agent workflows in MT, we are conducting a pilot study
in legal MT. The study employs a multi-agent system involving four specialized
AI agents for (i) translation, (ii) adequacy review, (iii) fluency review, and
(iv) final editing. Our findings suggest that multi-agent systems may have the
potential to significantly improve domain-adaptability and contextual
awareness, with superior translation quality to traditional MT or single-agent
systems. This paper also sets the stage for future research into multi-agent
applications in MT, integration into professional translation workflows, and
shares a demo of the system analyzed in the paper.

Result: 实验结果表明，IGCIDB能有效去偏LLM，提高其在不同任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: IGCIDB框架通过结合因果机制和信息理论，成功提升了LLM的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies indicate that current large
language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them during
inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. However, due to the
diversity of dataset biases and the insufficient nature of bias suppression
based on in-context learning, the effectiveness of previous prior
knowledge-based debiasing methods and in-context learning based automatic
debiasing methods is limited. To address these challenges, we explore the
combination of causal mechanisms with information theory and propose an
information gain-guided causal intervention debiasing (IGCIDB) framework. This
framework first utilizes an information gain-guided causal intervention method
to automatically and autonomously balance the distribution of
instruction-tuning dataset. Subsequently, it employs a standard supervised
fine-tuning process to train LLMs on the debiased dataset. Experimental results
show that IGCIDB can effectively debias LLM to improve its generalizability
across different tasks.

country's values? Occasionally they do! However, existing works primarily focus
on ethical reviews, failing to capture the diversity of national values, which
encompass broader policy, legal, and moral considerations. Furthermore, current
benchmarks that rely on spectrum tests using manually designed questionnaires
are not easily scalable.
  To address these limitations, we introduce NaVAB, a comprehensive benchmark
to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with the values of five major nations: China,
the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. NaVAB implements a
national value extraction pipeline to efficiently construct value assessment
datasets. Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure with instruction
tagging to process raw data sources, a screening process to filter
value-related topics and a generation process with a Conflict Reduction
mechanism to filter non-conflicting values.We conduct extensive experiments on
various LLMs across countries, and the results provide insights into assisting
in the identification of misaligned scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate that
NaVAB can be combined with alignment techniques to effectively reduce value
concerns by aligning LLMs' values with the target country.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需反馈的重试机制，提升LLM推理性能，简单方法可能优于复杂框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有迭代推理策略的计算复杂性和成本高问题。

Method: 引入‘retrials without feedback’概念，允许LLM在识别错误答案时重试，不需自反或反馈。

Result: 简单重试方法往往优于复杂推理框架。

Conclusion: 挑战复杂策略的必要性，建议简单方法可能足够。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the
development of general-purpose autonomous agents, demonstrating remarkable
performance in complex reasoning tasks across various domains. This surge has
spurred the evolution of a plethora of prompt-based reasoning frameworks. A
recent focus has been on iterative reasoning strategies that refine outputs
through self-evaluation and verbalized feedback. However, these strategies
require additional computational complexity to enable models to recognize and
correct their mistakes, leading to a significant increase in their cost. In
this work, we introduce the concept of ``retrials without feedback'', an
embarrassingly simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing reasoning frameworks
by allowing LLMs to retry problem-solving attempts upon identifying incorrect
answers. Unlike conventional iterative refinement methods, our method does not
require explicit self-reflection or verbalized feedback, simplifying the
refinement process. Our findings indicate that simpler retrial-based approaches
often outperform more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, suggesting that the
benefits of complex methods may not always justify their computational costs.
By challenging the prevailing assumption that more intricate reasoning
strategies inherently lead to better performance, our work offers new insights
into how simpler, more efficient approaches can achieve optimal results. So,
are retrials all you need?

TL;DR: 这篇论文从信息论角度分析LLM处理知识冲突的问题，并提出Swin-VIB框架来改善响应生成，实验显示单选任务准确率至少提升7.54%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在内部记忆和外部检索信息之间存在知识冲突，导致响应不可靠和不确定性，需要通过新方法解决。

Method: 从信息论视角分析冲突，并提出Swin-VIB框架，整合变分信息瓶颈模型用于自适应信息增强和引导LLM偏好。

Result: 实验验证了理论发现，并在单选、开放式QA和RAG任务中显示Swin-VIB的有效性，单选任务准确率至少提高7.54%。

Conclusion: Swin-VIB框架能有效处理知识冲突，提升LLM在响应生成中的性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
information retrieval systems, particularly in response generation (RG).
Unfortunately, LLMs often face knowledge conflicts between internal memory and
retrievaled external information, arising from misinformation, biases, or
outdated knowledge. These conflicts undermine response reliability and
introduce uncertainty in decision-making. In this work, we analyze how LLMs
navigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic perspective and
reveal that when conflicting and supplementary information exhibit significant
differences, LLMs confidently resolve their preferences. However, when the
distinction is ambiguous, LLMs experience heightened uncertainty. Based on this
insight, we propose Swin-VIB, a novel framework that integrates a pipeline of
variational information bottleneck models into adaptive augmentation of
retrieved information and guiding LLM preference in response generation.
Extensive experiments on single-choice, open-ended question-answering (QA), and
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate the efficacy of Swin-VIB. Notably, our method improves
single-choice task accuracy by at least 7.54\% over competitive baselines.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练中会记忆敏感信息，公开部署时存在风险，而现有机器遗忘方法难以在不降低整体能力的情况下选择性地移除特定数据关联。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：结合因果中介分析和层级特定优化，通过在OLMo架构上的因果追踪实验识别关键层，并使用约束优化冻结上层，在下层应用联合损失函数最大化遗忘集损失并最小化保留集偏差。

Result: 在1B模型轨道中获得第二名，保持88%的基线MMLU准确率，证明了因果信息层优化在LLM遗忘中的高效性。

Conclusion: 确立了基于因果的层优化作为LLM遗忘的有前景范式，为解决AI数据隐私问题提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive information during
training, posing risks when deploying publicly accessible models. Current
machine unlearning methods struggle to selectively remove specific data
associations without degrading overall model capabilities. This paper presents
our solution to SemEval-2025 Task 4 on targeted unlearning, which introduces a
two-stage methodology that combines causal mediation analysis with
layer-specific optimization. Through systematic causal tracing experiments on
OLMo architectures (1B and 7B parameters), we identify the critical role of the
first few transformer layers (layers 0-5) in storing subject-attribute
associations within MLP modules. Building on this insight, we develop a
constrained optimization approach that freezes upper layers while applying a
novel joint loss function to lower layers-simultaneously maximizing forget set
loss via output token cross-entropy penalties and minimizing retain set
deviation through adaptive regularization. Our method achieves 2nd place in the
1B model track, demonstrating strong task performance while maintaining 88% of
baseline MMLU accuracy. These results establish causal-informed layer
optimization as a promising paradigm for efficient, precise unlearning in LLMs,
offering a significant step forward in addressing data privacy concerns in AI
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型难以捕捉复杂的人类偏好和泛化到未见数据，因此需要改进以处理噪声和不一致性。

Conclusion: 证明EBRM是一种可扩展、有效的增强方法，可应用于现有奖励模型和对齐管道。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex
human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges,
we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc
refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM
models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human
preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It
achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware
contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs
without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across
different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate
significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to
a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard
RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined
rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These
results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for
existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.

Conclusion: 该框架在方面-based 摘要任务中表现出色，成功 mitigated 大型语言模型的挑战，提高了摘要生成的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries tailored to specific
aspects, addressing the resource constraints and limited generalizability of
traditional summarization approaches. Recently, large language models have
shown promise in this task without the need for training. However, they rely
excessively on prompt engineering and face token limits and hallucination
challenges, especially with in-context learning. To address these challenges,
in this paper, we propose a novel framework for aspect-based summarization:
Self-Aspect Retrieval Enhanced Summary Generation. Rather than relying solely
on in-context learning, given an aspect, we employ an embedding-driven
retrieval mechanism to identify its relevant text segments. This approach
extracts the pertinent content while avoiding unnecessary details, thereby
mitigating the challenge of token limits. Moreover, our framework optimizes
token usage by deleting unrelated parts of the text and ensuring that the model
generates output strictly based on the given aspect. With extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our framework not only achieves
superior performance but also effectively mitigates the token limitation
problem.

TL;DR: This paper develops a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based architecture for controlled language model generation, allowing small models to outperform larger ones in constrained tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many language model applications require text generation with syntactic or semantic constraints, but exact methods are intractable, necessitating more efficient approaches.

Method: Proposes an SMC framework that incorporates constraints at inference time and builds on Lew et al. (2023) for flexible and efficient generation.

Result: Small open-source models outperform models over 8x larger and closed-source ones in domains like code generation and text-to-SQL, due to better posterior distribution approximation.

Conclusion: Offers a simple, programmable system for applying SMC to various controlled generation problems, enhancing performance and usability.

Abstract: A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to
syntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally
framed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting
distribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution
-- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for
controlled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC
framework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific
constraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational
resources in light of new information during the course of generation. By
comparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains
-- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and
molecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach
allows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger,
as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic
perspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better
approximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework
of Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic
programming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a
broad variety of controlled generation problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解决在安全关键的NLP应用中，仅使用准确率作为评估指标的局限性，探索模型准确率与专家一致性的关系。

Method: 方法包括评估五种深度学习模型（如BERT变体、USE和零-shot分类器）和四种大型语言模型（如GPT-4、LLaMA 3、Qwen、Claude），并使用Cohen's Kappa、PCA和SHAP技术量化模型与专家的一致性。

Result: 结果显示，高准确率模型往往与专家一致性较低，而大型语言模型尽管准确率较低，却有更高的专家一致性；专家一致的模型更依赖上下文和时间语言线索，而非位置特定关键词。

Conclusion: 结论强调准确率不足以评估模型，应将专家一致性作为补充指标，并指出大型语言模型在崩溃分析中的潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between deep learning (DL) model
accuracy and expert agreement in the classification of crash narratives. We
evaluate five DL models -- including BERT variants, the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE), and a zero-shot classifier -- against expert-labeled data and
narrative text. The analysis is further extended to four large language models
(LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen, and Claude. Our results reveal a counterintuitive
trend: models with higher technical accuracy often exhibit lower agreement with
domain experts, whereas LLMs demonstrate greater expert alignment despite
relatively lower accuracy scores. To quantify and interpret model-expert
agreement, we employ Cohen's Kappa, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and
SHAP-based explainability techniques. Findings indicate that expert-aligned
models tend to rely more on contextual and temporal language cues, rather than
location-specific keywords. These results underscore that accuracy alone is
insufficient for evaluating models in safety-critical NLP applications. We
advocate for incorporating expert agreement as a complementary metric in model
evaluation frameworks and highlight the promise of LLMs as interpretable,
scalable tools for crash analysis pipelines.

Motivation: 现有工作通常孤立处理这些挑战，本文旨在同时考虑多个因素，以模拟更真实的冲突证据场景。

Method: 提出RAMDocs数据集模拟复杂场景，并开发MADAM-RAG多代理方法，通过代理辩论和聚合器处理歧义和错误信息。

Result: MADAM-RAG在AmbigDocs数据集上比基线提升11.40%，在FaithEval上提升15.80%，但RAMDocs对基线模型（如Llama3.3-70B-Instruct）具有挑战性，仅得32.60的精确匹配分。

Conclusion: MADAM-RAG有效改善了性能，但分析显示在证据不平衡情况下仍有较大改进空间。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly employing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the factuality of their
responses. However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous
user queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources
while also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant
documents. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in
isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or
robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors
simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and
Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and
realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including
ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent
approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple
rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to
disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby
handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which
requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over
strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires
suppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with
Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for
existing RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match
score). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our
analysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing
the level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零-shot协调是人类兼容AI的关键，先前工作无法泛化到新任务，因此需要开发能适应新伙伴和问题的代理。

Method: 使用强化学习在环境分布上训练单一伙伴，引入CEC范式，并利用Jax-based程序生成器创建大量协调挑战。

Result: CEC在与真实人类合作时定量和定性上优于基线，代理发展出通用规范，有效支持不同伙伴的协作。

Conclusion: 结果表明，通过跨环境学习，代理可设计出无需人类数据即可与人类交互的通用合作系统。

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC), the ability to adapt to a new partner in a
cooperative task, is a critical component of human-compatible AI. While prior
work has focused on training agents to cooperate on a single task, these
specialized models do not generalize to new tasks, even if they are highly
similar. Here, we study how reinforcement learning on a distribution of
environments with a single partner enables learning general cooperative skills
that support ZSC with many new partners on many new problems. We introduce two
Jax-based, procedural generators that create billions of solvable coordination
challenges. We develop a new paradigm called Cross-Environment Cooperation
(CEC), and show that it outperforms competitive baselines quantitatively and
qualitatively when collaborating with real people. Our findings suggest that
learning to collaborate across many unique scenarios encourages agents to
develop general norms, which prove effective for collaboration with different
partners. Together, our results suggest a new route toward designing generalist
cooperative agents capable of interacting with humans without requiring human
data.

efficiency, role allocation, environmental adaptation, and task parallelism.
The framework divides MAS into seven layers: multi-agent collaboration,

single-agent multi-capability incarnation, different single agents using the
same large model to achieve the same target agent, single-agent using different
large models to achieve the same target agent, and multi-agent synthesis of the
same target agent. Through experimental validation in art creation, the
framework demonstrates its unique advantages in task collaboration, cross-scene
adaptation, and model fusion. This paper further discusses current challenges
such as collaboration mechanism optimization, model stability, and system
security, proposing future exploration through technologies like meta-learning
and federated learning. The framework provides a structured methodology for
multi-agent collaboration in AI art creation and promotes innovative
applications in the art field.

Conclusion: 该框架为更高级的政策探索奠定基础，但承认了限制和未来研究需求。

Abstract: Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep
uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests.
Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable
tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating
potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be
inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization
approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and
comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting
climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address
these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate
simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis,
including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state
spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation.
Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions
interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation
for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important
limitations and areas for future research.

Result: 在标准MARL基准测试中，QLLM优于现有基线，展示出强的泛化能力和兼容性。

Conclusion: QLLM是一个有前景的通用解决方案，适用于复杂的多代理场景。

Abstract: Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this
issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with
decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to
approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the
global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in
various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including
imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor
scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic
construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs).
Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit
allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear
functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is
further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of
executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination
and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on
several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM
exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a
wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a
promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了RIS辅助波束聚焦的精度，改善了物联网通信性能。

Abstract: The massive number of antennas in extremely large aperture array (ELAA)
systems shifts the propagation regime of signals in internet of things (IoT)
communication systems towards near-field spherical wave propagation. We propose
a reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted beamfocusing mechanism,
where the design of the two-dimensional beam codebook that contains both the
angular and distance domains is challenging. To address this issue, we
introduce a novel Transformer-based two-stage beam training algorithm, which
includes the coarse and fine search phases. The proposed mechanism provides a
fine-grained codebook with enhanced spatial resolution, enabling precise
beamfocusing. Specifically, in the first stage, the beam training is performed
to estimate the approximate location of the device by using a simple codebook,
determining whether it is within the beamfocusing range (BFR) or the
none-beamfocusing range (NBFR). In the second stage, by using a more precise
codebook, a fine-grained beam search strategy is conducted. Experimental
results unveil that the precision of the RIS-assisted beamfocusing is greatly
improved. The proposed method achieves beam selection accuracy up to 97% at
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB, and improves 10% to 50% over the baseline
method at different SNRs.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that an eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system with appropriate analog combining
components exhibits the properties of a universal function approximator,
similar to a feedforward neural network. By treating the XL MIMO channel
coefficients as the random nodes of a hidden layer, and the receiver's analog
combiner as a trainable output layer, we cast the end-to-end system to the
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework, leading to a novel formulation for
Over-The-Air (OTA) edge inference without requiring traditional digital
processing nor pre-processing at the transmitter. Through theoretical analysis
and numerical evaluation, we showcase that XL-MIMO-ELM enables
near-instantaneous training and efficient classification, suggesting the
paradigm shift of beyond massive MIMO systems as neural networks alongside
their profound communications role. Compared to deep learning approaches and
conventional ELMs, the proposed framework achieves on par performance with
orders of magnitude lower complexity, making it highly attractive for ultra low
power wireless devices.

Abstract: Soft robots are increasingly used in healthcare, especially for assistive
care, due to their inherent safety and adaptability. Controlling soft robots is
challenging due to their nonlinear dynamics and the presence of time delays,
especially in applications like a soft robotic arm for patient care. This paper
presents a learning-based approach to approximate the nonlinear state predictor
(Smith Predictor), aiming to improve tracking performance in a two-module soft
robot arm with a short inherent input delay. The method uses Kernel Recursive
Least Squares Tracker (KRLST) for online learning of the system dynamics and a
Legendre Delay Network (LDN) to compress past input history for efficient delay
compensation. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in
tracking performance compared to a baseline model-based non-linear controller.
Statistical analysis confirms the significance of the improvements. The method
is computationally efficient and adaptable online, making it suitable for
real-world scenarios and highlighting its potential for enabling safer and more
accurate control of soft robots in assistive care applications.

Conclusion: 提供可扩展、可解释的方法，桥接机器人控制中的模拟-现实差距。

Abstract: Accurately modeling friction in robotics remains a core challenge, as
robotics simulators like Mujoco and PyBullet use simplified friction models or
heuristics to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, where these
simplifications and approximations can lead to substantial differences between
simulated and physical performance. In this paper, we present a
physics-informed friction estimation framework that enables the integration of
well-established friction models with learnable components-requiring only
minimal, generic measurement data. Our approach enforces physical consistency
yet retains the flexibility to adapt to real-world complexities. We
demonstrate, on an underactuated and nonlinear system, that the learned
friction models, trained solely on small and noisy datasets, accurately
simulate dynamic friction properties and reduce the sim-to-real gap. Crucially,
we show that our approach enables the learned models to be transferable to
systems they are not trained on. This ability to generalize across multiple
systems streamlines friction modeling for complex, underactuated tasks,
offering a scalable and interpretable path toward bridging the sim-to-real gap
in robotics and control.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation robots are continuously advancing, with their grasping
capabilities rapidly progressing. However, there are still significant gaps
preventing state-of-the-art mobile manipulators from widespread real-world
deployments, including their ability to reliably grasp items in unstructured
environments. To help bridge this gap, we developed SHOPPER, a mobile
manipulation robot platform designed to push the boundaries of reliable and
generalizable grasp strategies. We develop these grasp strategies and deploy
them in a real-world grocery store -- an exceptionally challenging setting
chosen for its vast diversity of manipulable items, fixtures, and layouts. In
this work, we present our detailed approach to designing general grasp
strategies towards picking any item in a real grocery store. Additionally, we
provide an in-depth analysis of our latest real-world field test, discussing
key findings related to fundamental failure modes over hundreds of distinct
pick attempts. Through our detailed analysis, we aim to offer valuable
practical insights and identify key grasping challenges, which can guide the
robotics community towards pressing open problems in the field.

Result: 在多种停车场景模拟中验证，显著提高了效率和安全性，优于现有样条-based方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了停车路径规划的安全性和计算效率。

Abstract: Safe and efficient path planning in parking scenarios presents a significant
challenge due to the presence of cluttered environments filled with static and
dynamic obstacles. To address this, we propose a novel and computationally
efficient planning strategy that seamlessly integrates the predictions of
dynamic obstacles into the planning process, ensuring the generation of
collision-free paths. Our approach builds upon the conventional Hybrid A star
algorithm by introducing a time-indexed variant that explicitly accounts for
the predictions of dynamic obstacles during node exploration in the graph, thus
enabling dynamic obstacle avoidance. We integrate the time-indexed Hybrid A
star algorithm within an online planning framework to compute local paths at
each planning step, guided by an adaptively chosen intermediate goal. The
proposed method is validated in diverse parking scenarios, including
perpendicular, angled, and parallel parking. Through simulations, we showcase
our approach's potential in greatly improving the efficiency and safety when
compared to the state of the art spline-based planning method for parking
situations.

Conclusion: 该方法为理解人类驾驶员早顶点或晚顶点 maneuvers 的原因提供了新途径。

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to bias the driving style of an
artificial race driver (ARD) for online time-optimal trajectory planning. Our
method leverages a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework that
combines time minimization with exit speed maximization at the end of the
planning horizon. We introduce a new MPC terminal cost formulation based on the
trajectory planned in the previous MPC step, enabling ARD to adapt its driving
style from early to late apex maneuvers in real-time. Our approach is
computationally efficient, allowing for low replan times and long planning
horizons. We validate our method through simulations, comparing the results
against offline minimum-lap-time (MLT) optimal control and online minimum-time
MPC solutions. The results demonstrate that our new terminal cost enables ARD
to bias its driving style, and achieve online lap times close to the MLT
solution and faster than the minimum-time MPC solution. Our approach paves the
way for a better understanding of the reasons behind human drivers' choice of
early or late apex maneuvers.

Conclusion: 结合了学习-based感知和可解释模型-based控制的优势，提供了一个高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Modeling and control of nonlinear dynamics are critical in robotics,
especially in scenarios with unpredictable external influences and complex
dynamics. Traditional cascaded modular control pipelines often yield suboptimal
performance due to conservative assumptions and tedious parameter tuning. Pure
data-driven approaches promise robust performance but suffer from low sample
efficiency, sim-to-real gaps, and reliance on extensive datasets. Hybrid
methods combining learning-based and traditional model-based control in an
end-to-end manner offer a promising alternative. This work presents a
self-supervised learning framework combining learning-based inertial odometry
(IO) module and differentiable model predictive control (d-MPC) for Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) attitude control. The IO denoises raw IMU measurements and
predicts UAV attitudes, which are then optimized by MPC for control actions in
a bi-level optimization (BLO) setup, where the inner MPC optimizes control
actions and the upper level minimizes discrepancy between real-world and
predicted performance. The framework is thus end-to-end and can be trained in a
self-supervised manner. This approach combines the strength of learning-based
perception with the interpretable model-based control. Results show the
effectiveness even under strong wind. It can simultaneously enhance both the
MPC parameter learning and IMU prediction performance.

Result: 实现经验上紧密的松弛，计算负担轻，并能通过单个半定规划求解分段仿射最优控制问题。

Conclusion: 该方法提供高效解决非凸最优控制问题的途径，提高了计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce a semidefinite relaxation for optimal control of linear systems
with time scaling. These problems are inherently nonconvex, since the system
dynamics involves bilinear products between the discretization time step and
the system state and controls. The proposed relaxation is closely related to
the standard second-order semidefinite relaxation for quadratic constraints,
but we carefully select a subset of the possible bilinear terms and apply a
change of variables to achieve empirically tight relaxations while keeping the
computational load light. We further extend our method to handle
piecewise-affine (PWA) systems by formulating the PWA optimal-control problem
as a shortest-path problem in a graph of convex sets (GCS). In this GCS,
different paths represent different mode sequences for the PWA system, and the
convex sets model the relaxed dynamics within each mode. By combining a tight
convex relaxation of the GCS problem with our semidefinite relaxation with time
scaling, we can solve PWA optimal-control problems through a single
semidefinite program.

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills often requires collecting
hundreds of demonstrations using wearables or teleoperation, a process that is
challenging to scale. Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect
and scale, but leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to
the lack of explicit action labels from videos and morphological differences
between robot and human hands. We propose Human2Sim2Robot, a novel
real-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies
using only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes
reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the human-robot embodiment
gap without relying on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection
typically necessary for imitation learning methods. From the demonstration, we
extract two task-specific components: (1) the object pose trajectory to define
an object-centric, embodiment-agnostic reward function, and (2) the
pre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration during RL
training. We found that these two components are highly effective for learning
the desired task, eliminating the need for task-specific reward shaping and
tuning. We demonstrate that Human2Sim2Robot outperforms object-aware open-loop
trajectory replay by 55% and imitation learning with data augmentation by 68%
across grasping, non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks. Project

Result: 在五个真实数据集上，位置识别准确率平均为77%±2m，平均误差比基线低2倍。

Conclusion: 该方法成功处理复杂环境中的全局定位问题，并提供了多模态位置分布。

Abstract: Mobile robots on construction sites require accurate pose estimation to
perform autonomous surveying and inspection missions. Localization in
construction sites is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of
repetitive features such as flat plastered walls and perceptual aliasing due to
apartments with similar layouts inter and intra floors. In this paper, we focus
on the global re-positioning of a robot with respect to an accurate scanned
mesh of the building solely using LiDAR data. In our approach, a neural network
is trained on synthetic LiDAR point clouds generated by simulating a LiDAR in
an accurate real-life large-scale mesh. We train a diffusion model with a
PointNet++ backbone, which allows us to model multiple position candidates from
a single LiDAR point cloud. The resulting model can successfully predict the
global position of LiDAR in confined and complex sites despite the adverse
effects of perceptual aliasing. The learned distribution of potential global
positions can provide multi-modal position distribution. We evaluate our
approach across five real-world datasets and show the place recognition
accuracy of 77% +/-2m on average while outperforming baselines at a factor of 2
in mean error.

Abstract: Adapting robot trajectories based on human instructions as per new situations
is essential for achieving more intuitive and scalable human-robot
interactions. This work proposes a flexible language-based framework to adapt
generic robotic trajectories produced by off-the-shelf motion planners like
RRT, A-star, etc, or learned from human demonstrations. We utilize pre-trained
LLMs to adapt trajectory waypoints by generating code as a policy for dense
robot manipulation, enabling more complex and flexible instructions than
current methods. This approach allows us to incorporate a broader range of
commands, including numerical inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art
feature-based sequence-to-sequence models which require training, our method
does not require task-specific training and offers greater interpretability and
more effective feedback mechanisms. We validate our approach through simulation
experiments on the robotic manipulator, aerial vehicle, and ground robot in the
Pybullet and Gazebo simulation environments, demonstrating that LLMs can
successfully adapt trajectories to complex human instructions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of graph neural networks (GNNs) with
Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) for scene understanding in automated
driving. Scene understanding is the basis for any further reactive or proactive
decision-making. Scene understanding and related reasoning is inherently an
explanation task: why is another traffic participant doing something, what or
who caused their actions? While previous work demonstrated QXGs' effectiveness
using shallow machine learning models, these approaches were limited to
analysing single relation chains between object pairs, disregarding the broader
scene context. We propose a novel GNN architecture that processes entire graph
structures to identify relevant objects in traffic scenes. We evaluate our
method on the nuScenes dataset enriched with DriveLM's human-annotated
relevance labels. Experimental results show that our GNN-based approach
achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods. The model
effectively handles the inherent class imbalance in relevant object
identification tasks while considering the complete spatial-temporal
relationships between all objects in the scene. Our work demonstrates the
potential of combining qualitative representations with deep learning
approaches for explainable scene understanding in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of robotics, dual-arm coordination and complex
object manipulation are essential capabilities for developing advanced
autonomous systems. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality
demonstration data and real-world-aligned evaluation benchmarks severely limits
such development. To address this, we introduce RoboTwin, a generative digital
twin framework that uses 3D generative foundation models and large language
models to produce diverse expert datasets and provide a real-world-aligned
evaluation platform for dual-arm robotic tasks. Specifically, RoboTwin creates
varied digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and
interactive scenarios. It also introduces a spatial relation-aware code
generation framework that combines object annotations with large language
models to break down tasks, determine spatial constraints, and generate precise
robotic movement code. Our framework offers a comprehensive benchmark with both
simulated and real-world data, enabling standardized evaluation and better
alignment between simulated training and real-world performance. We validated
our approach using the open-source COBOT Magic Robot platform. Policies
pre-trained on RoboTwin-generated data and fine-tuned with limited real-world
samples demonstrate significant potential for enhancing dual-arm robotic
manipulation systems by improving success rates by over 70% for single-arm
tasks and over 40% for dual-arm tasks compared to models trained solely on
real-world data.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is a fundamental capability for robotic systems, yet
progress has been limited by hardware trade-offs between precision,
compactness, strength, and affordability. Existing control methods impose
compromises on hand designs and applications. However, learning-based
approaches present opportunities to rethink these trade-offs, particularly to
address challenges with tendon-driven actuation and low-cost materials. This
work presents RUKA, a tendon-driven humanoid hand that is compact, affordable,
and capable. Made from 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components, RUKA has
5 fingers with 15 underactuated degrees of freedom enabling diverse human-like
grasps. Its tendon-driven actuation allows powerful grasping in a compact,
human-sized form factor. To address control challenges, we learn
joint-to-actuator and fingertip-to-actuator models from motion-capture data
collected by the MANUS glove, leveraging the hand's morphological accuracy.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate RUKA's superior reachability, durability, and
strength compared to other robotic hands. Teleoperation tasks further showcase
RUKA's dexterous movements. The open-source design and assembly instructions of
RUKA, code, and data are available at https://ruka-hand.github.io/.

Abstract: In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact
reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from
a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By
quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the
Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the
mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion
transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the
critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes,
the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle
density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy
models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of
the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the
exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.

posterior for each subset, and applies VB approximation independently to these
posteriors. The resulting variational posteriors with respect to the subsets
are then aggregated using the geometric median of probability measures,
computed with respect to the Wasserstein distance. This novel aggregation
method yields the Variational Median Posterior (VM-Posterior) distribution. We
rigorously demonstrate that the VM-Posterior preserves contraction properties
akin to those of the true posterior, while accounting for approximation errors
or the variational gap inherent in VB methods. We also provide provable
robustness guarantee of the VM-Posterior. Furthermore, we establish a
variational Bernstein-von Mises theorem for both multivariate Gaussian
distributions with general covariance structures and the mean-field variational
family. To facilitate practical implementation, we adapt existing algorithms
for computing the VM-Posterior and evaluate its performance through extensive
numerical experiments. The results highlight its robustness and scalability,
making it a reliable tool for Bayesian inference in the presence of complex,
contaminated datasets.

Abstract: Spectral algorithms leverage spectral regularization techniques to analyze
and process data, providing a flexible framework for addressing supervised
learning problems. To deepen our understanding of their performance in
real-world scenarios where the distributions of training and test data may
differ, we conduct a rigorous investigation into the convergence behavior of
spectral algorithms under distribution shifts, specifically within the
framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our study focuses on the case
of covariate shift. In this scenario, the marginal distributions of the input
data differ between the training and test datasets, while the conditional
distribution of the output given the input remains unchanged. Under this
setting, we analyze the generalization error of spectral algorithms and show
that they achieve minimax optimality when the density ratios between the
training and test distributions are uniformly bounded. However, we also
identify a critical limitation: when the density ratios are unbounded, the
spectral algorithms may become suboptimal. To address this limitation, we
propose a weighted spectral algorithm that incorporates density ratio
information into the learning process. Our theoretical analysis shows that this
weighted approach achieves optimal capacity-independent convergence rates.
Furthermore, by introducing a weight clipping technique, we demonstrate that
the convergence rates of the weighted spectral algorithm can approach the
optimal capacity-dependent convergence rates arbitrarily closely. This
improvement resolves the suboptimality issue in unbounded density ratio
scenarios and advances the state-of-the-art by refining existing theoretical
results.

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于更好地理解随机森林在实际应用中的表现，尤其在协变量相关情况下。

Abstract: We study the effectiveness of randomizing split-directions in random forests.
Prior literature has shown that, on the one hand, randomization can reduce
variance through decorrelation, and, on the other hand, randomization
regularizes and works in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. First,
we bring together and revisit decorrelation and regularization by presenting a
systematic analysis of out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) for different SNR
scenarios based on commonly-used data-generating processes. We find that
variance reduction tends to increase with the SNR and forests outperform
bagging when the SNR is low because, in low SNR cases, variance dominates bias
for both methods. Second, we show that the effectiveness of randomization is a
question that goes beyond the SNR. We present a simulation study with fixed and
moderate SNR, in which we examine the effectiveness of randomization for other
data characteristics. In particular, we find that (i) randomization can
increase bias in the presence of fat tails in the distribution of covariates;
(ii) in the presence of irrelevant covariates randomization is ineffective
because bias dominates variance; and (iii) when covariates are mutually
correlated randomization tends to be effective because variance dominates bias.
Beyond randomization, we find that, for both bagging and random forests, bias
can be significantly reduced in the presence of correlated covariates. This
last finding goes beyond the prevailing view that averaging mostly works by
variance reduction. Given that in practice covariates are often correlated, our
findings on correlated covariates could open the way for a better understanding
of why random forests work well in many applications.

Result: 结果显示，在具有自协变性的单索引模型中，多项式数量的神经元足以紧密逼近均值场动态，收敛时间为维度的多项式增长。

Conclusion: 结论是，在特定条件下，有限宽度神经网络可以有效模拟无限宽度神经网络的训练过程。

Abstract: We study the approximation gap between the dynamics of a polynomial-width
neural network and its infinite-width counterpart, both trained using projected
gradient descent in the mean-field scaling regime. We demonstrate how to
tightly bound this approximation gap through a differential equation governed
by the mean-field dynamics. A key factor influencing the growth of this ODE is
the local Hessian of each particle, defined as the derivative of the particle's
velocity in the mean-field dynamics with respect to its position. We apply our
results to the canonical feature learning problem of estimating a
well-specified single-index model; we permit the information exponent to be
arbitrarily large, leading to convergence times that grow polynomially in the
ambient dimension $d$. We show that, due to a certain ``self-concordance''
property in these problems -- where the local Hessian of a particle is bounded
by a constant times the particle's velocity -- polynomially many neurons are
sufficient to closely approximate the mean-field dynamics throughout training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释深度神经网络中泛化延迟的现象，并通过多种现象的共享时间结构来支持这一观点。

Method: 通过实证研究在两个不同设置中分析现象，使用互信息作为进度指标，并与电路-based指标比较。

Result: 发现三种现象的时间尺度对齐，互信息作为自然进度指标，并论证压缩阶段对泛化重要。

Conclusion: 建议压缩阶段是一种原则性的遗忘形式，对泛化至关重要，但可能被标准训练算法不必要地延长。

Abstract: We propose that learning in deep neural networks proceeds in two phases: a
rapid curve fitting phase followed by a slower compression or coarse graining
phase. This view is supported by the shared temporal structure of three
phenomena: grokking, double descent and the information bottleneck, all of
which exhibit a delayed onset of generalization well after training error
reaches zero. We empirically show that the associated timescales align in two
rather different settings. Mutual information between hidden layers and input
data emerges as a natural progress measure, complementing circuit-based metrics
such as local complexity and the linear mapping number. We argue that the
second phase is not actively optimized by standard training algorithms and may
be unnecessarily prolonged. Drawing on an analogy with the renormalization
group, we suggest that this compression phase reflects a principled form of
forgetting, critical for generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成代码重复导致的效率低下和可读性问题。

Method: 通过实证研究19个LLM，总结重复模式，并提出基于规则的DeRep技术。

Result: DeRep减少重复指标平均提升91.3%至93.5%，Pass@1提高208.3%，优于基线。

Conclusion: DeRep有效降低代码重复并提升代码质量。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation,
the quality of LLM-generated code still faces significant challenges. One
significant issue is code repetition, which refers to the model's tendency to
generate structurally redundant code, resulting in inefficiencies and reduced
readability. To address this, we conduct the first empirical study to
investigate the prevalence and nature of repetition across 19 state-of-the-art
code LLMs using three widely-used benchmarks. Our study includes both
quantitative and qualitative analyses, revealing that repetition is pervasive
and manifests at various granularities and extents, including character,
statement, and block levels. We further summarize a taxonomy of 20 repetition
patterns. Building on our findings, we propose DeRep, a rule-based technique
designed to detect and mitigate repetition in generated code. We evaluate DeRep
using both open-source benchmarks and in an industrial setting. Our results
demonstrate that DeRep significantly outperforms baselines in reducing
repetition (with an average improvements of 91.3%, 93.5%, and 79.9% in rep-3,
rep-line, and sim-line metrics) and enhancing code quality (with a Pass@1
increase of 208.3% over greedy search). Furthermore, integrating DeRep improves
the performance of existing repetition mitigation methods, with Pass@1
improvements ranging from 53.7% to 215.7%.

Result: 系统能识别递归模式，提供可操作洞见，处理IT隐喻，并为通用查询工具铺路。

Conclusion: 正式化存在语言可实现系统完整性，论文讨论了优势和限制。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel research analytical IT system grounded in Martin
Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology, distinguishing between beings (das Seiende)
and Being (das Sein). The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively
complete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs
and an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are
bridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze
user queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT
specialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide
actionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited
to categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological
existential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query
processing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as
metaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves
formalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's
Fundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of
beings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way
for a universal query analysis tool. The paper presents the system's
architecture, operational principles, technical implementation, use
cases--including a case based on real IT specialist dialogues--comparative
evaluation with existing tools, and its advantages and limitations.

Result: 微调后模型生成大量新拓扑材料，Ge₂Bi₂O₆为例，具有0.26 eV的完全带隙，是已知最大带隙之一。

Conclusion: ReFT方法有效，能够在不显著影响材料稳定性的情况下提升生成拓扑材料的性能。

Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) and topological crystalline insulators (TCIs)
are materials with unconventional electronic properties, making their discovery
highly valuable for practical applications. However, such materials,
particularly those with a full band gap, remain scarce. Given the limitations
of traditional approaches that scan known materials for candidates, we focus on
the generation of new topological materials through a generative model.
Specifically, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT) to a pre-trained
generative model, thereby aligning the model's objectives with our material
design goals. We demonstrate that ReFT is effective in enhancing the model's
ability to generate TIs and TCIs, with minimal compromise on the stability of
the generated materials. Using the fine-tuned model, we successfully identify a
large number of new topological materials, with Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$ serving as a
representative example--a TI with a full band gap of 0.26 eV, ranking among the
largest known in this category.

Abstract: Reservoir computing can embed attractors into random neural networks (RNNs),
generating a ``mirror'' of a target attractor because of its inherent

parameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed
analysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation
scenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are now reaching
operational-grade performance for some variables, but like traditional
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they exhibit systematic biases and
reliability issues. We test the application of the Bureau of Meteorology's
existing statistical post-processing system, IMPROVER, to ECMWF's deterministic
Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), and compare results against
post-processed outputs from the ECMWF HRES and ENS models. Without any
modification to configuration or processing workflows, post-processing yields
comparable accuracy improvements for AIFS as for traditional NWP forecasts, in
both expected value and probabilistic outputs. We show that blending AIFS with
NWP models improves overall forecast skill, even when AIFS alone is not the
most accurate component. These findings show that statistical post-processing
methods developed for NWP are directly applicable to AI models, enabling
national meteorological centres to incorporate AI forecasts into existing
workflows in a low-risk, incremental fashion.

Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, all existing methods that can generate
synthetic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for a specific
individual require detailed structural or volumetric information about the
individual's brain. However, such brain information is often scarce, expensive,

demographic, interview, and cognitive test information. Our approach features a
novel deep generative model, CSegSynth, which outperforms existing prominent

Abstract: Proximal gradient methods are popular in sparse optimization as they are
straightforward to implement. Nevertheless, they achieve biased solutions,
requiring many iterations to converge. This work addresses these issues through
a suitable feedback control of the algorithm's hyperparameter. Specifically, by
designing an integral control that does not substantially impact the
computational complexity, we can reach an unbiased solution in a reasonable

the proposed approach for strongly-convex problems. Moreover, numerical

Abstract: We consider SGD-type optimization on infinite-dimensional quadratic problems
with power law spectral conditions. It is well-known that on such problems
deterministic GD has loss convergence rates $L_t=O(t^{-\zeta})$, which can be
improved to $L_t=O(t^{-2\zeta})$ by using Heavy Ball with a non-stationary
Jacobi-based schedule (and the latter rate is optimal among fixed schedules).
However, in the mini-batch Stochastic GD setting, the sampling noise causes the
Jacobi HB to diverge; accordingly no $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ algorithm is known. In
this paper we show that rates up to $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ can be achieved by a
generalized stationary SGD with infinite memory. We start by identifying
generalized (S)GD algorithms with contours in the complex plane. We then show
that contours that have a corner with external angle $\theta\pi$ accelerate the
plain GD rate $O(t^{-\zeta})$ to $O(t^{-\theta\zeta})$. For deterministic GD,
increasing $\theta$ allows to achieve rates arbitrarily close to
$O(t^{-2\zeta})$. However, in Stochastic GD, increasing $\theta$ also amplifies
the sampling noise, so in general $\theta$ needs to be optimized by balancing
the acceleration and noise effects. We prove that the optimal rate is given by
$\theta_{\max}=\min(2,\nu,\tfrac{2}{\zeta+1/\nu})$, where $\nu,\zeta$ are the
exponents appearing in the capacity and source spectral conditions.
Furthermore, using fast rational approximations of the power functions, we show
that ideal corner algorithms can be efficiently approximated by finite-memory
algorithms, and demonstrate their practical efficiency on a synthetic problem
and MNIST.

Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic
processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our
result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and
effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean
and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in the sense that it only
depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration.
We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known
concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing
effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's
convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er
monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly
general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro
procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their
applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of
potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other
well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation, covering a range
of different applied scenarios to which our methods can be immediately applied.
Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which even
allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.

Conclusion: WaterFlow是视觉水印领域的重大进步，提供高保真、快速和极强鲁棒性的解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to embed watermarks in images is a fundamental problem of
interest for computer vision, and is exacerbated by the rapid rise of generated
imagery in recent times. Current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from
computational and statistical challenges such as the slow execution speed for
practical deployments. In addition, other works trade off fast watermarking
speeds but suffer greatly in their robustness or perceptual quality. In this
work, we propose WaterFlow (WF), a fast and extremely robust approach for high
fidelity visual watermarking based on a learned latent-dependent watermark. Our
approach utilizes a pretrained latent diffusion model to encode an arbitrary
image into a latent space and produces a learned watermark that is then planted
into the Fourier Domain of the latent. The transformation is specified via
invertible flow layers that enhance the expressivity of the latent space of the
pre-trained model to better preserve image quality while permitting robust and
tractable detection. Most notably, WaterFlow demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance on general robustness and is the first method capable of
effectively defending against difficult combination attacks. We validate our
findings on three widely used real and generated datasets: MS-COCO,

Motivation: 解决数字病理学中标注劳动密集、计算需求高以及缺乏不确定性估计导致的信任问题。

Method: 使用自编码器提取特征，基于不确定性选择代表性补丁，进行无监督的核分割，并整合到临床工作流中。

Result: 在UPENN-GBM数据集上，AE的MSE为0.0016；在MoNuSeg数据集上，F1分数77.46%、Jaccard分数63.35%，优于其他无监督方法。

Conclusion: 证明了TUMLS在推进数字病理学领域的效能，提高了工作流的速度和透明度。

Abstract: Digital pathology, augmented by artificial intelligence (AI), holds
significant promise for improving the workflow of pathologists. However,
challenges such as the labor-intensive annotation of whole slide images (WSIs),
high computational demands, and trust concerns arising from the absence of
uncertainty estimation in predictions hinder the practical application of
current AI methodologies in histopathology. To address these issues, we present
a novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology
(TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to
identify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data. It
selects representative patches from each identified group based on an
uncertainty measure and then does unsupervised nuclei segmentation in their
respective higher-resolution space without using any ML algorithms. Crucially,
this solution integrates seamlessly into clinicians workflows, transforming the
examination of a whole WSI into a review of concise, interpretable cross-level
insights. This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow
while ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM
dataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016.
Additionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset,
outperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a
Jaccard score of 63.35%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TUMLS in
advancing the field of digital pathology.

TL;DR: ViTa 模型整合心脏磁共振成像和患者级因素，提供全面心脏健康表示，支持多种临床任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整合 CMR 和患者级健康因素以全面理解心脏健康和疾病风险。

Method: 使用 42,000 个 UK Biobank 参与者数据，融合 3D+T cine 图像和表格患者因素，学习共享潜在表示。

Result: 实现了心脏表型预测、分割和疾病分类等任务，支持统一框架。

Conclusion: 推进通用患者特定心脏健康理解，提高临床效用和可扩展性。

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive
cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy
and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic,
and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and
disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand
cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an
individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly
exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have
begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data
and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a
comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a
comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of
individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants,
ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling
a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with
detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This
multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including
cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and
classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified
framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging
features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific
models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health,
highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in
cardiac analysis.

Abstract: Foundation models in digital pathology use massive datasets to learn useful
compact feature representations of complex histology images. However, there is
limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and
performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to
increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a
prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology
data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing
reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using
guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures
biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We
demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset
achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models
trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our
synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across
multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on
orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic
and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several
evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create
compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the
reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our
approach.

Motivation: 工业异常检测中真实缺陷样本稀缺，3D数据利用不足，需要探索3D异常生成以提升表面质量检查。

Method: 基于Perlin噪声和表面参数化，将点云投影到2D平面，采样多尺度噪声，并沿法线方向扰动点云生成异常。

Result: 实验显示参数（如噪声规模、扰动强度）可精细控制异常多样性，跨类别生成一致且几何合理的缺陷。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了3D异常生成的空白，并提供代码库促进未来研究。

Abstract: Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in
various vision tasks. However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity
of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models.
While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established
generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has
made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In
contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored,
limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address
this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS,
based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates
realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane,
sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the
point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization
experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale,
perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the
generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from
pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our
cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet
geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to
their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive
codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Accurate prediction and stabilization of blast furnace temperatures are
crucial for optimizing the efficiency and productivity of steel production.
Traditional methods often struggle with the complex and non-linear nature of
the temperature fluctuations within blast furnaces. This paper proposes a novel
approach that combines hybrid quantum machine learning with pulverized coal
injection control to address these challenges. By integrating classical machine
learning techniques with quantum computing algorithms, we aim to enhance
predictive accuracy and achieve more stable temperature control. For this we
utilized a unique prediction-based optimization method. Our method leverages
quantum-enhanced feature space exploration and the robustness of classical
regression models to forecast temperature variations and optimize pulverized
coal injection values. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in
prediction accuracy over 25 percent and our solution improved temperature
stability to +-7.6 degrees of target range from the earlier variance of +-50
degrees, highlighting the potential of hybrid quantum machine learning models
in industrial steel production applications.

Abstract: Benchmarks that concisely summarize the performance of many-qubit quantum
computers are essential for measuring progress towards the goal of useful
quantum computation. In this work, we present a benchmarking framework that is
based on quantifying how a quantum computer's performance on quantum circuits
varies as a function of features of those circuits, such as circuit depth,
width, two-qubit gate density, problem input size, or algorithmic depth. Our
featuremetric benchmarking framework generalizes volumetric benchmarking -- a
widely-used methodology that quantifies performance versus circuit width and
depth -- and we show that it enables richer and more faithful models of quantum
computer performance. We demonstrate featuremetric benchmarking with example
benchmarks run on IBM Q and IonQ systems of up to 27 qubits, and we show how to
produce performance summaries from the data using Gaussian process regression.
Our data analysis methods are also of interest in the special case of
volumetric benchmarking, as they enable the creation of intuitive
two-dimensional capability regions using data from few circuits.

Conclusion: 结论是查询复杂度可通过通道发散和保真度表征，提高了通道鉴别的效率分析。

Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic
perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error
probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this
paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein
the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a
desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of
binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error
probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and
Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely
characterize the query complexity of discriminating between two classical
channels. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of
binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel
discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric
R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends
on the negative logarithm of (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For
multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the
number of channels.

Conclusion: 群集学习框架能有效提升数据有限情况下的估计准确性，同时保持隐私和安全性。

Abstract: Data-driven methods have shown potential in electric-vehicle battery
management tasks such as capacity estimation, but their deployment is
bottlenecked by poor performance in data-limited scenarios. Sharing battery
data among algorithm developers can enable accurate and generalizable
data-driven models. However, an effective battery management framework that
simultaneously ensures data privacy and fault tolerance is still lacking. This
paper proposes a swarm battery management system that unites a decentralized
swarm learning (SL) framework and credibility weight-based model merging
mechanism to enhance battery capacity estimation in data-limited scenarios
while ensuring data privacy and security. The effectiveness of the SL framework
is validated on a dataset comprising 66 commercial LiNiCoAlO2 cells cycled
under various operating conditions. Specifically, the capacity estimation
performance is validated in four cases, including data-balanced, volume-biased,
feature-biased, and quality-biased scenarios. Our results show that SL can
enhance the estimation accuracy in all data-limited cases and achieve a similar
level of accuracy with central learning where large amounts of data are
available.

Conclusion: 强调在公用事业规模太阳能规划中整合经济考虑，以更好地协调脱碳目标与区域经济开发。

Abstract: The Midwest, with its vast agricultural lands, is rapidly emerging as a key
region for utility-scale solar expansion. However, traditional power planning
has yet to integrate local economic impact directly into capacity expansion to
guide optimal siting decisions. Moreover, existing economic assessments tend to
emphasize local benefits while overlooking the opportunity costs of converting
productive farmland for solar development. This study addresses these gaps by
endogenously incorporating local economic metrics into a power system planning
model to evaluate how economic impacts influence solar siting, accounting for
the cost of lost agricultural output. We analyze all counties within the Great
Lakes region, constructing localized supply and marginal benefit curves that
are embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at
minimizing system costs and maximizing community economic benefits. Our
findings show that counties with larger economies and lower farmland
productivity deliver the highest local economic benefit per megawatt (MW) of
installed solar capacity. In Ohio, for example, large counties generate up to
$34,500 per MW, driven in part by high property tax revenues, while smaller
counties yield 31% less. Accounting for the opportunity cost of displaced
agricultural output reduces local benefits by up to 16%, depending on farmland
quality. A scenario prioritizing solar investment in counties with higher
economic returns increases total economic benefits by $1 billion (or 11%) by
2040, with solar investment shifting away from Michigan and Wisconsin (down by
39%) toward Ohio and Indiana (up by 75%), with only a marginal increase of 0.5%
in system-wide costs. These findings underscore the importance of integrating
economic considerations into utility-scale solar planning to better align
decarbonization goals with regional and local economic development.

Abstract: Kalman filtering can provide an optimal estimation of the system state from
noisy observation data. This algorithm's performance depends on the accuracy of
system modeling and noise statistical characteristics, which are usually
challenging to obtain in practical applications. The powerful nonlinear
modeling capabilities of deep learning, combined with its ability to extract
features from large amounts of data automatically, offer new opportunities for
improving the Kalman filter. This paper proposes a novel method that leverages
the Spiking Neural Network to optimize the Kalman filter. Our approach aims to
reduce the reliance on prior knowledge of system and observation noises,
allowing for adaptation to varying statistical characteristics of time-varying
noise. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of SNNs in improving the
computational efficiency of the Kalman filter. In our method, we design an
integration strategy between the SNN and the Kalman filter. The SNN is trained
to directly approximate the optimal gain matrix from observation data, thereby
alleviating the computational burden of complex matrix operations inherent in
traditional Kalman filtering while maintaining the accuracy and robustness of
state estimation. Its average error has been reduced by 18\%-65\% compared with
other methods.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel state estimation framework that incorporates
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) into Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE), shifting from
traditional physics-based models to rapidly developed data-driven techniques. A
DNN model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) nodes is trained on synthetic data
generated by a high-fidelity thermal model of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Machine (PMSM), which undergoes thermal derating as part of the torque control
strategy in a battery electric vehicle. The MHE is constructed by integrating
the trained DNN with a simplified driving dynamics model in a discrete-time
formulation, incorporating the LSTM hidden and cell states in the state vector
to retain system dynamics. The resulting optimal control problem (OCP) is
formulated as a nonlinear program (NLP) and implemented using the acados
framework. Model-in-the-loop (MiL) simulations demonstrate accurate temperature
estimation, even under noisy sensor conditions or failures. Achieving threefold
real-time capability on embedded hardware confirms the feasibility of the
approach for practical deployment. The primary focus of this study is to assess
the feasibility of the MHE framework using a DNN-based plant model instead of
focusing on quantitative comparisons of vehicle performance. Overall, this
research highlights the potential of DNN-based MHE for real-time,
safety-critical applications by combining the strengths of model-based and
data-driven methods.

Abstract: The integration of renewable energy resources (RES) in the power grid can
reduce carbon intensity, but also presents certain challenges. The uncertainty
and intermittent nature of RES emphasize the need for flexibility in power
systems. Moreover, there are noticeable mismatches between real-time
electricity prices and carbon intensity patterns throughout the day. These
discrepancies may lead customers to schedule energy-intensive tasks during the
early hours of the day, a period characterized by lower electricity prices but
higher carbon intensity. This paper introduces a novel and comprehensive
framework aimed at encouraging customer participation in electricity markets
and aligning their flexibility with carbon intensity trends. The proposed
approach integrates an incentive-based tariff with a tri-level optimization
model, where customers are motivated to submit flexibility bids and, in return,
receive financial rewards based on their contributions. The tri-level model
ensures a dynamic interaction between the market operation platform (MOP) and
end-users. Simulations are performed on a modified IEEE-33 bus system,
supported by two scenarios with different RES generations and customer
behaviors. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in
guiding the customers' consumption behaviors towards low carbon intensity.

Abstract: This tutorial paper focuses on safe physics-informed machine learning in the
context of dynamics and control, providing a comprehensive overview of how to
integrate physical models and safety guarantees. As machine learning techniques
enhance the modeling and control of complex dynamical systems, ensuring safety
and stability remains a critical challenge, especially in safety-critical
applications like autonomous vehicles, robotics, medical decision-making, and
energy systems. We explore various approaches for embedding and ensuring safety
constraints, such as structural priors, Lyapunov functions, Control Barrier
Functions, predictive control, projections, and robust optimization techniques,
ensuring that the learned models respect stability and safety criteria.
Additionally, we delve into methods for uncertainty quantification and safety
verification, including reachability analysis and neural network verification
tools, which help validate that control policies remain within safe operating
bounds even in uncertain environments. The paper includes illustrative examples
demonstrating the implementation aspects of safe learning frameworks that
combine the strengths of data-driven approaches with the rigor of physical
principles, offering a path toward the safe control of complex dynamical
systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a new task-space Non-singular Terminal Super-Twisting
Sliding Mode (NT-STSM) controller with adaptive gains for robust trajectory
tracking of a 7-DOF robotic manipulator. The proposed approach addresses the
challenges of chattering, unknown disturbances, and rotational motion tracking,
making it suited for high-DOF manipulators in dexterous manipulation tasks. A
rigorous boundedness proof is provided, offering gain selection guidelines for
practical implementation. Simulations and hardware experiments with external
disturbances demonstrate the proposed controller's robust, accurate tracking
with reduced control effort under unknown disturbances compared to other
NT-STSM and conventional controllers. The results demonstrated that the
proposed NT-STSM controller mitigates chattering and instability in complex
motions, making it a viable solution for dexterous robotic manipulations and
various industrial applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提供AA的全面概述，帮助研究者和数据挖掘从业者理解其方法、应用和限制。

Method: 通过调查AA的方法学、应用领域和建模最佳实践。

Result: 总结了AA在科学领域的广泛应用、优势和挑战。

Conclusion: 解释AA的重要未来研究方向。

Abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) was originally proposed in 1994 by Adele Cutler and
Leo Breiman as a computational procedure to extract the distinct aspects called
archetypes in observations with each observational record approximated as a
mixture (i.e., convex combination) of these archetypes. AA thereby provides
straightforward, interpretable, and explainable representations for feature
extraction and dimensionality reduction, facilitating the understanding of the
structure of high-dimensional data with wide applications throughout the
sciences. However, AA also faces challenges, particularly as the associated
optimization problem is non-convex. This survey provides researchers and data
mining practitioners an overview of methodologies and opportunities that AA has
to offer surveying the many applications of AA across disparate fields of
science, as well as best practices for modeling data using AA and limitations.
The survey concludes by explaining important future research directions
concerning AA.

Result: 在模拟数据和空气质量数据集上展示了方法的良好性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理偏斜功能数据的聚类提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We propose a clustering method, funWeightClustSkew, based on mixtures of
functional linear regression models and three skewed multivariate
distributions: the variance-gamma distribution, the skew-t distribution, and
the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution. Our approach follows the framework of
the functional high dimensional data clustering (funHDDC) method, and we extend
to functional data the cluster weighted models based on skewed distributions
used for finite dimensional multivariate data. We consider several parsimonious
models, and to estimate the parameters we construct an expectation maximization
(EM) algorithm. We illustrate the performance of funWeightClustSkew for
simulated data and for the Air Quality dataset.

TL;DR: 本研究使用AI知识图谱分析可持续发展目标（SDG），基于TED Talk数据发现新关联并提出潜在新目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于2030年可持续发展目标进展滞后，需要创新策略来分析目标间连接和发现新目标。

Method: 开发AI知识图谱系统，使用SDG文本、关键词数据集和TED Talk transcripts，应用AI推测设计、大语言模型和检索增强生成。

Result: 发现Goal 10和16强关联、Goal 6覆盖少；模拟对话揭示新中心节点；提出六个新目标，聚焦公平、韧性和技术包容。

Conclusion: 该框架为决策者提供新见解，并为未来多模态SDG应用奠定基础。

Abstract: From 2000 to 2015, the UN's Millennium Development Goals guided global
priorities. The subsequent Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted a more
dynamic approach, with annual indicator updates. As 2030 nears and progress
lags, innovative acceleration strategies are critical. This study develops an
AI-powered knowledge graph system to analyze SDG interconnections, discover
potential new goals, and visualize them online. Using official SDG texts,
Elsevier's keyword dataset, and 1,127 TED Talk transcripts (2020-2023), a pilot
on 269 talks from 2023 applies AI-speculative design, large language models,
and retrieval-augmented generation. Key findings include: (1) Heatmap analysis
reveals strong associations between Goal 10 and Goal 16, and minimal coverage
of Goal 6. (2) In the knowledge graph, simulated dialogue over time reveals new
central nodes, showing how richer data supports divergent thinking and goal
clarity. (3) Six potential new goals are proposed, centered on equity,
resilience, and technology-driven inclusion. This speculative-AI framework
offers fresh insights for policymakers and lays groundwork for future
multimodal and cross-system SDG applications.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了德国和美国公众对AI对齐特征的偏好，发现美国支持度更高，准确性和安全最受重视。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI进展引发公众对安全、公平和社会价值的期望，需要了解跨国差异。

Method: 通过在德国（n=1800）和美国（n=1756）进行的两项调查，考察AI调节的四种对齐类型：准确性、安全、偏见缓解和理想化想象。

Result: 美国受访者AI使用更高，支持所有对齐特征；准确性和安全最受欢迎，德国更谨慎；AI使用、言论自由等因素影响偏好。

Conclusion: 为AI治理辩论提供证据，强调基于公众态度的理论和政策讨论。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence have raised public
awareness, shaping expectations and concerns about their societal implications.
Central to these debates is the question of AI alignment -- how well AI systems
meet public expectations regarding safety, fairness, and social values.
However, little is known about what people expect from AI-enabled systems and
how these expectations differ across national contexts. We present evidence
from two surveys of public preferences for key functional features of
AI-enabled systems in Germany (n = 1800) and the United States (n = 1756). We
examine support for four types of alignment in AI moderation: accuracy and
reliability, safety, bias mitigation, and the promotion of aspirational
imaginaries. U.S. respondents report significantly higher AI use and
consistently greater support for all alignment features, reflecting broader
technological openness and higher societal involvement with AI. In both
countries, accuracy and safety enjoy the strongest support, while more
normatively charged goals -- like fairness and aspirational imaginaries --
receive more cautious backing, particularly in Germany. We also explore how
individual experience with AI, attitudes toward free speech, political
ideology, partisan affiliation, and gender shape these preferences. AI use and
free speech support explain more variation in Germany. In contrast, U.S.
responses show greater attitudinal uniformity, suggesting that higher exposure
to AI may consolidate public expectations. These findings contribute to debates
on AI governance and cross-national variation in public preferences. More
broadly, our study demonstrates the value of empirically grounding AI alignment
debates in public attitudes and of explicitly developing normatively grounded
expectations into theoretical and policy discussions on the governance of
AI-generated content.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 这篇论文创建了第一个针对大规模枪击事件的数据集，使用命名实体识别（NER）和大语言模型（LLM）提取关键信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模枪击事件产生非结构化数据，阻碍调查和政策，现有研究自动化提取不足。

Method: 使用LLM如GPT-4o和o1-mini的少样本提示，从新闻、警报告和社交媒体中进行NER提取实体。

Result: GPT-4o在微精度、微召回和微F1分数上最佳，o1-mini竞争力强，增加样本数显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LLM在少样本NER任务中有效，GPT-4o最优，o1-mini是资源高效选择。

Abstract: Mass-shooting events pose a significant challenge to public safety,
generating large volumes of unstructured textual data that hinder effective
investigations and the formulation of public policy. Despite the urgency, few
prior studies have effectively automated the extraction of key information from
these events to support legal and investigative efforts. This paper presented
the first dataset designed for knowledge acquisition on mass-shooting events
through the application of named entity recognition (NER) techniques. It
focuses on identifying key entities such as offenders, victims, locations, and
criminal instruments, that are vital for legal and investigative purposes. The
NER process is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using few-shot
prompting, facilitating the efficient extraction and organization of critical
information from diverse sources, including news articles, police reports, and
social media. Experimental results on real-world mass-shooting corpora
demonstrate that GPT-4o is the most effective model for mass-shooting NER,
achieving the highest Micro Precision, Micro Recall, and Micro F1-scores.
Meanwhile, o1-mini delivers competitive performance, making it a
resource-efficient alternative for less complex NER tasks. It is also observed
that increasing the shot count enhances the performance of all models, but the
gains are more substantial for GPT-4o and o1-mini, highlighting their superior
adaptability to few-shot learning scenarios.

Motivation: 针对高风险领域如网络操作中 AI 的可靠性和可信度问题，大语言模型存在幻觉，因此开发 LinkQ 系统强制 LLM 查询知识图谱获取真实数据。

Method: 开发开源自然语言接口 LinkQ，强制 LLM 在问答中查询知识图谱；使用 KGQA 数据集进行定量评估，并与领域专家进行定性研究。

Result: LinkQ 定量上优于 GPT-4 但在某些问题类别上表现不佳；专家反馈提供了建议、限制和未来机会。

Conclusion: 需要调查替代查询构建策略，以改进未来 LLM 查询系统的性能。

Abstract: High-stakes domains like cyber operations need responsible and trustworthy AI
methods. While large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular
in these domains, they still suffer from hallucinations. This research paper
provides learning outcomes from a case study with LinkQ, an open-source natural
language interface that was developed to combat hallucinations by forcing an
LLM to query a knowledge graph (KG) for ground-truth data during
question-answering (QA). We conduct a quantitative evaluation of LinkQ using a
well-known KGQA dataset, showing that the system outperforms GPT-4 but still
struggles with certain question categories - suggesting that alternative query
construction strategies will need to be investigated in future LLM querying
systems. We discuss a qualitative study of LinkQ with two domain experts using
a real-world cybersecurity KG, outlining these experts' feedback, suggestions,
perceived limitations, and future opportunities for systems like LinkQ.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文主张LLM在XAI中应充当批评者角色，以改善用户理解并减少过度依赖，而不是仅进行解释翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM在XAI中使用可能导致过度依赖和解释性幻觉的问题。

Method: 提出LLM作为建设性搅局者，通过审问解释、突出偏见和限制来发挥作用。

Result: 有可能减少过度依赖并促进用户与AI系统的批判性互动。

Conclusion: LLM应帮助用户批判性地参与AI解释，以提升透明度。

Abstract: This position paper highlights a growing trend in Explainable AI (XAI)
research where Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to translate outputs from
explainability techniques, like feature-attribution weights, into a natural
language explanation. While this approach may improve accessibility or
readability for users, recent findings suggest that translating into human-like
explanations does not necessarily enhance user understanding and may instead
lead to overreliance on AI systems. When LLMs summarize XAI outputs without
surfacing model limitations, uncertainties, or inconsistencies, they risk
reinforcing the illusion of interpretability rather than fostering meaningful
transparency. We argue that - instead of merely translating XAI outputs - LLMs
should serve as constructive agitators, or devil's advocates, whose role is to
actively interrogate AI explanations by presenting alternative interpretations,
potential biases, training data limitations, and cases where the model's
reasoning may break down. In this role, LLMs can facilitate users in engaging
critically with AI systems and generated explanations, with the potential to
reduce overreliance caused by misinterpreted or specious explanations.

Motivation: 填补对AI辅助写作如何影响写作过程和作家代理的系统性理解空白。

Method: 使用PRISMA方法系统回顾109篇HCI论文，并结合15位不同领域作家的访谈。

Result: 识别四种设计策略（结构化指导、引导探索、主动共写、批判性反馈），并揭示作家偏好随写作阶段、目标和价值观的变化。

Conclusion: 提供可操作的设计指导，以开发以人为本的AI写作工具。

Abstract: As generative AI tools like ChatGPT become integral to everyday writing,
critical questions arise about how to preserve writers' sense of agency and
ownership when using these tools. Yet, a systematic understanding of how AI
assistance affects different aspects of the writing process - and how this
shapes writers' agency - remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conducted a systematic review of 109 HCI papers using the PRISMA approach. From
this literature, we identify four overarching design strategies for AI writing
support: structured guidance, guided exploration, active co-writing, and
critical feedback - mapped across the four key cognitive processes in writing:
planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. We complement this analysis
with interviews of 15 writers across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that
writers' desired levels of AI intervention vary across the writing process:
content-focused writers (e.g., academics) prioritize ownership during planning,
while form-focused writers (e.g., creatives) value control over translating and
reviewing. Writers' preferences are also shaped by contextual goals, values,
and notions of originality and authorship. By examining when ownership matters,
what writers want to own, and how AI interactions shape agency, we surface both
alignment and gaps between research and user needs. Our findings offer
actionable design guidance for developing human-centered writing tools for
co-writing with AI, on human terms.

Conclusion: 这种框架有助于量化MLLMs的可解释性，提高人类推理能力和揭示现有感知数据集的偏差。

Abstract: In this paper, we advance the study of AI-augmented reasoning in the context
of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), psychology and cognitive science, focusing
on the critical task of visual perception. Specifically, we investigate the
applicability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain. To
this end, we leverage established principles and explanations from psychology
and cognitive science related to complexity in human visual perception. We use
them as guiding principles for the MLLMs to compare and interprete visual
content. Our study aims to benchmark MLLMs across various explainability
principles relevant to visual perception. Unlike recent approaches that
primarily employ advanced deep learning models to predict complexity metrics
from visual content, our work does not seek to develop a mere new predictive
model. Instead, we propose a novel annotation-free analytical framework to
assess utility of MLLMs as cognitive assistants for HCI tasks, using visual
perception as a case study. The primary goal is to pave the way for principled
study in quantifying and evaluating the interpretability of MLLMs for
applications in improving human reasoning capability and uncovering biases in
existing perception datasets annotated by humans.

Motivation: 动机是处理匿名公告可能泄露身份的问题，类似于消息板或俄罗斯扑克牌谜题，介于标准公告和代理人公告之间。

Result: 结果包括形式表达性结果和公理完备性证明。

Conclusion: 结论是这种形式化提升了对匿名公告在认识论逻辑中的理解，并提供了关键洞见。

Abstract: We formalise the notion of an \emph{anonymous public announcement} in the
tradition of public announcement logic. Such announcements can be seen as
in-between a public announcement from ``the outside" (an announcement of
$\phi$) and a public announcement by one of the agents (an announcement of
$K_a\phi$): we get more information than just $\phi$, but not (necessarily)
about exactly who made it. Even if such an announcement is prima facie
anonymous, depending on the background knowledge of the agents it might reveal
the identity of the announcer: if I post something on a message board, the
information might reveal who I am even if I don't sign my name. Furthermore,
like in the Russian Cards puzzle, if we assume that the announcer's intention
was to stay anonymous, that in fact might reveal more information. In this
paper we first look at the case when no assumption about intentions are made,
in which case the logic with an anonymous public announcement operator is
reducible to epistemic logic. We then look at the case when we assume common
knowledge of the intention to stay anonymous, which is both more complex and
more interesting: in several ways it boils down to the notion of a ``safe"
announcement (again, similarly to Russian Cards). Main results include formal
expressivity results and axiomatic completeness for key logical languages.

Result: 证明MCP Guardian有效缓解攻击，并以最小开销实现稳健监督。

Conclusion: 促进AI助手的可扩展安全数据访问，强调防御深度方法在AI环境中的重要性。

Abstract: As Agentic AI gain mainstream adoption, the industry invests heavily in model
capabilities, achieving rapid leaps in reasoning and quality. However, these
systems remain largely confined to data silos, and each new integration
requires custom logic that is difficult to scale. The Model Context Protocol
(MCP) addresses this challenge by defining a universal, open standard for
securely connecting AI-based applications (MCP clients) to data sources (MCP
servers). However, the flexibility of the MCP introduces new risks, including
malicious tool servers and compromised data integrity. We present MCP Guardian,
a framework that strengthens MCP-based communication with authentication,
rate-limiting, logging, tracing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) scanning.
Through real-world scenarios and empirical testing, we demonstrate how MCP
Guardian effectively mitigates attacks and ensures robust oversight with
minimal overheads. Our approach fosters secure, scalable data access for AI
assistants, underscoring the importance of a defense-in-depth approach that
enables safer and more transparent innovation in AI-driven environments.

Result: 与通用方法相比，系统显示出更好的性能和效率。

Conclusion: 定制的语言模型在银行交易分类中具有优势。

Abstract: With the introduction of the PSD2 regulation in the EU which established the
Open Banking framework, a new window of opportunities has opened for banks and
fintechs to explore and enrich Bank transaction descriptions with the aim of
building a better understanding of customer behavior, while using this
understanding to prevent fraud, reduce risks and offer more competitive and
tailored services.
  And although the usage of natural language processing models and techniques
has seen an incredible progress in various applications and domains over the
past few years, custom applications based on domain-specific text corpus remain
unaddressed especially in the banking sector.
  In this paper, we introduce a language-based Open Banking transaction
classification system with a focus on the french market and french language
text. The system encompasses data collection, labeling, preprocessing,
modeling, and evaluation stages. Unlike previous studies that focus on general
classification approaches, this system is specifically tailored to address the
challenges posed by training a language model with a specialized text corpus
(Banking data in the French context). By incorporating language-specific
techniques and domain knowledge, the proposed system demonstrates enhanced
performance and efficiency compared to generic approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统的性能评估存在离线指标与在线行为脱节的问题，且真实用户数据稀缺并受隐私限制。

Method: 开发SimUSER框架，从历史数据中提取一致性人格，构建具有人格、记忆、感知和大脑模块的代理用户，与推荐系统交互。

Conclusion: 通过SimUSER框架的离线A/B测试，优化推荐系统参数，实现了真实世界中用户参与度的改善。

Abstract: Recommender systems play a central role in numerous real-life applications,
yet evaluating their performance remains a significant challenge due to the gap
between offline metrics and online behaviors. Given the scarcity and limits
(e.g., privacy issues) of real user data, we introduce SimUSER, an agent
framework that serves as believable and cost-effective human proxies. SimUSER
first identifies self-consistent personas from historical data, enriching user
profiles with unique backgrounds and personalities. Then, central to this
evaluation are users equipped with persona, memory, perception, and brain
modules, engaging in interactions with the recommender system. SimUSER exhibits
closer alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at micro and macro
levels. Additionally, we conduct insightful experiments to explore the effects
of thumbnails on click rates, the exposure effect, and the impact of reviews on
user engagement. Finally, we refine recommender system parameters based on
offline A/B test results, resulting in improved user engagement in the real
world.

### [227] [Towards Lossless Token Pruning in Late-Interaction Retrieval Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12778)
*Yuxuan Zong,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出一种原则性方法修剪ColBERT模型标记，不影响检索分数，并通过实验证明使用仅30%的标记即可保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ColBERT模型需大量内存存储上下文表示，现有的修剪方法无法保证不影响检索分数。

Method: 引入三种正则化损失和两种修剪策略，以实现高修剪率。

Result: 实验显示，在域内和域外，使用仅30%的标记即可保留ColBERT的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效修剪标记，显著减少内存使用，同时保持检索效果。

Abstract: Late interaction neural IR models like ColBERT offer a competitive
effectiveness-efficiency trade-off across many benchmarks. However, they
require a huge memory space to store the contextual representation for all the
document tokens. Some works have proposed using either heuristics or
statistical-based techniques to prune tokens from each document. This however
doesn't guarantee that the removed tokens have no impact on the retrieval
score. Our work uses a principled approach to define how to prune tokens
without impacting the score between a document and a query. We introduce three
regularization losses, that induce a solution with high pruning ratios, as well
as two pruning strategies. We study them experimentally (in and out-domain),
showing that we can preserve ColBERT's performance while using only 30\% of the
tokens.

### [228] [FreshStack: Building Realistic Benchmarks for Evaluating Retrieval on Technical Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13128)
*Nandan Thakur,Jimmy Lin,Sam Havens,Michael Carbin,Omar Khattab,Andrew Drozdov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FreshStack 是一个框架，用于从社区问题和答案自动构建信息检索（IR）评估基准。它包括语料库收集、关键点生成和检索支持，构建了五个数据集，显示现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了创建现实、可扩展且未受污染的 IR 和 RAG 评估基准，特别是在快速增长的主题上，以解决现有方法不足的问题。

Method: 框架步骤包括：(1) 自动从代码和技术文档收集语料库，(2) 从社区 Q&A 生成关键点，(3) 使用融合检索技术和混合架构进行文档检索，并构建五个数据集。

Result: 现有检索模型显著低于理想表现，在所有五个主题上都有改进空间；rerankers 在两个主题上未明显提升准确性。

Conclusion: 希望促进未来构建更真实、可扩展 IR 和 RAG 基准的工作，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: We introduce FreshStack, a reusable framework for automatically building
information retrieval (IR) evaluation benchmarks from community-asked questions
and answers. FreshStack conducts the following steps: (1) automatic corpus
collection from code and technical documentation, (2) nugget generation from
community-asked questions and answers, and (3) nugget-level support, retrieving
documents using a fusion of retrieval techniques and hybrid architectures. We
use FreshStack to build five datasets on fast-growing, recent, and niche topics
to ensure the tasks are sufficiently challenging. On FreshStack, existing
retrieval models, when applied out-of-the-box, significantly underperform
oracle approaches on all five topics, denoting plenty of headroom to improve IR
quality. In addition, we identify cases where rerankers do not clearly improve
first-stage retrieval accuracy (two out of five topics). We hope that
FreshStack will facilitate future work toward constructing realistic, scalable,
and uncontaminated IR and RAG evaluation benchmarks. FreshStack datasets are
available at: https://fresh-stack.github.io.
