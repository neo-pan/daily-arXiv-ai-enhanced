### [1] [Interpretable AI-driven Guidelines for Type 2 Diabetes Treatment from Observational Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12417)
*Dewang Kumar Agarwal,Dimitris J. Bertsimas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本论文使用AI开发2型糖尿病治疗指南，显示HbA1c降低比医生改善0.13-0.26%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建精确、结构化、基于数据的2型糖尿病治疗进展指南，适合临床采用。

Method: 使用机器学习优化患者数据，训练树模型去除偏差，创建治疗处方管道，并在外部数据上测试。

Result: 中位HbA1c降低比医生多0.26%（BMC数据）和0.13%（Hartford数据）。

Conclusion: AI方法优于当前实践，可部署改善患者结果。

Abstract: Objective: Create precise, structured, data-backed guidelines for type 2
diabetes treatment progression, suitable for clinical adoption.
  Research Design and Methods: Our training cohort was composed of patient
(with type 2 diabetes) visits from Boston Medical Center (BMC) from 1998 to
2014. We divide visits into 4 groups based on the patient's treatment regimen
before the visit, and further divide them into subgroups based on the
recommended treatment during the visit. Since each subgroup has observational
data, which has confounding bias (sicker patients are prescribed more
aggressive treatments), we used machine learning and optimization to remove
some datapoints so that the remaining data resembles a randomized trial. On
each subgroup, we train AI-backed tree-based models to prescribe treatment
changes. Once we train these tree models, we manually combine the models for
every group to create an end-to-end prescription pipeline for all patients in
that group. In this process, we prioritize stepping up to a more aggressive
treatment before considering less aggressive options. We tested this pipeline
on unseen data from BMC, and an external dataset from Hartford healthcare (type
2 diabetes patient visits from January 2020 to May 2024).
  Results: The median HbA1c reduction achieved by our pipelines is 0.26% more
than what the doctors achieved on the unseen BMC patients. For the Hartford
cohort, our pipelines were better by 0.13%.
  Conclusions: This precise, interpretable, and efficient AI-backed approach to
treatment progression in type 2 diabetes is predicted to outperform the current
practice and can be deployed to improve patient outcomes.

### [2] [Towards Conversational AI for Human-Machine Collaborative MLOps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12477)
*George Fatouros,Georgios Makridis,George Kousiouris,John Soldatos,Anargyros Tsadimas,Dimosthenis Kyriazis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型的对话代理系统，用于提升MLOps中人机协作的可访问性，通过Swarm Agent架构整合专业代理实现自然语言交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂MLOps平台如Kubeflow的可访问性差距，使高级ML工具对不同技术背景的用户更易使用。

Method: 开发Swarm Agent分层模块化架构，包含KFP Agent、MinIO Agent和RAG Agent，通过迭代推理循环和上下文感知处理支持对话式ML工作流管理。

Result: 系统通过对话界面使用户能够发现、执行和监控ML管道、管理数据并访问文档，降低了复杂性和进入门槛。

Conclusion: 这种对话式MLOps助手提高了可访问性和扩展性，论文通过架构和实现细节证明了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a Large Language Model (LLM) based conversational agent
system designed to enhance human-machine collaboration in Machine Learning
Operations (MLOps). We introduce the Swarm Agent, an extensible architecture
that integrates specialized agents to create and manage ML workflows through
natural language interactions. The system leverages a hierarchical, modular
design incorporating a KubeFlow Pipelines (KFP) Agent for ML pipeline
orchestration, a MinIO Agent for data management, and a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) Agent for domain-specific knowledge integration. Through
iterative reasoning loops and context-aware processing, the system enables
users with varying technical backgrounds to discover, execute, and monitor ML
pipelines; manage datasets and artifacts; and access relevant documentation,
all via intuitive conversational interfaces. Our approach addresses the
accessibility gap in complex MLOps platforms like Kubeflow, making advanced ML
tools broadly accessible while maintaining the flexibility to extend to other
platforms. The paper describes the architecture, implementation details, and
demonstrates how this conversational MLOps assistant reduces complexity and
lowers barriers to entry for users across diverse technical skill levels.

*Luciano Floridi,Carlotta Buttaboni,Emmie Hine,Jessica Morley,Claudio Novelli,Tyler Schroder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了Agentic AI Optimisation (AAIO)，用于优化网站与智能AI代理的交互，类似于SEO，并讨论了其治理、伦理、法律和社会影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AAI)系统的出现，需要一个新的优化范式来确保代理和平台之间的无缝交互。

Method: 通过考察网站优化与代理AI成功之间的相互依赖性，并探索治理、伦理、法律和社会影响(GELSI)。

Result: 突出了AAIO可能创建的良性循环，并强调了主动监管框架的必要性，以减轻潜在负面影响。

Conclusion: 肯定了AAIO在自主数字代理时代作为数字基础设施的基本作用，并倡导公平和包容性的访问。

Abstract: The emergence of Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AAI) systems capable of
independently initiating digital interactions necessitates a new optimisation
paradigm designed explicitly for seamless agent-platform interactions. This
article introduces Agentic AI Optimisation (AAIO) as an essential methodology
for ensuring effective integration between websites and agentic AI systems.
Like how Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) has shaped digital content
discoverability, AAIO can define interactions between autonomous AI agents and
online platforms. By examining the mutual interdependency between website
optimisation and agentic AI success, the article highlights the virtuous cycle
that AAIO can create. It further explores the governance, ethical, legal, and
social implications (GELSI) of AAIO, emphasising the necessity of proactive
regulatory frameworks to mitigate potential negative impacts. The article
concludes by affirming AAIO's essential role as part of a fundamental digital
infrastructure in the era of autonomous digital agents, advocating for
equitable and inclusive access to its benefits.

### [4] [Heuristic Recognition and Rapid Response to Unfamiliar Events Outside of Agent Design Scope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12497)
*Robert E. Wray,Steven J. Jones,John E. Laird*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了智能代理在开放世界中如何应对超出经验范围的情况，并提出结合元知识和元推理的方法以实现快速适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是代理在面对未知情况时可能缺乏知识或时间，需要快速识别和响应。

Method: 方法是结合基于人类认知的评估作为领域通用元知识，以及元推理。

Result: 结果是这种方法有潜力提供快速、适应的响应。

Conclusion: 结论是这种方法能更全面地满足开放世界代理的性能需求。

Abstract: Regardless of past learning, an agent in an open world will face unfamiliar
situations and events outside of prior experience, existing models, or
policies. Further, the agent will sometimes lack relevant knowledge and/or
sufficient time to assess the situation, generate and evaluate options, and
pursue a robustly considered course of action. How can an agent respond
reasonably to situations that are outside of its original design scope? How can
it recognize such situations sufficiently quickly and reliably to determine
reasonable, adaptive courses of action? We identify key characteristics needed
for solutions, evaluate the state-of-the-art by these requirements, and outline
a proposed, novel approach that combines domain-general meta-knowledge (in the
form of appraisals inspired by human cognition) and metareasoning. It has the
potential to provide fast, adaptive responses to unfamiliar situations, more
fully meeting the performance characteristics required for open-world, general
agents.

### [5] [Is Trust Correlated With Explainability in AI? A Meta-Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12529)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R. Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这项元分析研究发现，AI可解释性与用户信任有中等正相关，但并非唯一因素；强调培养持久可信赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战AI可解释性必然提升用户信任的普遍假设。

Method: 采用元分析方法，分析90项文献数据。

Result: 结果显示统计显著的中等正相关，表明可解释性有助于信任但不是主导因素。

Conclusion: 强调AI可解释性的社会技术影响，促进责任感与信任，解决偏差和透明问题，主张构建持久可信赖AI。

Abstract: This study critically examines the commonly held assumption that
explicability in artificial intelligence (AI) systems inherently boosts user
trust. Utilizing a meta-analytical approach, we conducted a comprehensive
examination of the existing literature to explore the relationship between AI
explainability and trust. Our analysis, incorporating data from 90 studies,
reveals a statistically significant but moderate positive correlation between
the explainability of AI systems and the trust they engender among users. This
indicates that while explainability contributes to building trust, it is not
the sole or predominant factor in this equation. In addition to academic
contributions to the field of Explainable AI (XAI), this research highlights
its broader socio-technical implications, particularly in promoting
accountability and fostering user trust in critical domains such as healthcare
and justice. By addressing challenges like algorithmic bias and ethical
transparency, the study underscores the need for equitable and sustainable AI
adoption. Rather than focusing solely on immediate trust, we emphasize the
normative importance of fostering authentic and enduring trustworthiness in AI
systems.

### [6] [ZeroSumEval: Scaling LLM Evaluation with Inter-Model Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12562)
*Haidar Khan,Hisham A. Alyahya,Yazeed Alnumay,M Saiful Bari,Bülent Yener*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ZeroSumEval是一种基于零和游戏的动态基准评估方法，用于评估LLM的能力，发现其在创造力等方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LLM评估方法存在过拟合、高成本和偏差问题，因此提出ZeroSumEval来提供动态、抵抗饱和的基准。

Method: 开发ZeroSumEval协议，包括多种游戏（如PyJail、Chess等），进行超过7000次模拟实验，涉及7个游戏和13个模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，GPT和Claude系列前沿模型能处理常见游戏和问题，但难以创建新颖问题，且在越狱和创造力任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在某些能力上仍有局限，ZeroSumEval提供了一个标准化的评估框架，并开源代码。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has traditionally
relied on static benchmark datasets, human assessments, or model-based
evaluations - methods that often suffer from overfitting, high costs, and
biases. ZeroSumEval is a novel competition-based evaluation protocol that
leverages zero-sum games to assess LLMs with dynamic benchmarks that resist
saturation. ZeroSumEval encompasses a diverse suite of games, including
security challenges (PyJail), classic games (Chess, Liar's Dice, Poker),
knowledge tests (MathQuiz), and persuasion challenges (Gandalf, Debate). These
games are designed to evaluate a range of AI capabilities such as strategic
reasoning, planning, knowledge application, and creativity. Building upon
recent studies that highlight the effectiveness of game-based evaluations for
LLMs, ZeroSumEval enhances these approaches by providing a standardized and
extensible framework. To demonstrate this, we conduct extensive experiments
with >7000 simulations across 7 games and 13 models. Our results show that
while frontier models from the GPT and Claude families can play common games
and answer questions, they struggle to play games that require creating novel
and challenging questions. We also observe that models cannot reliably
jailbreak each other and fail generally at tasks requiring creativity. We
release our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/ZeroSumEval.

### [7] [The Chronicles of Foundation AI for Forensics of Multi-Agent Provenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12612)
*Ching-Chun Chang,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种后验归因系统，通过象征性编年史追踪多代理生成内容的来源历史，而不依赖内部内存或外部元信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理在协作中内容不断修改，难以追踪贡献来源，因此需要追踪provenance的方法。

Method: 使用反馈循环和符号化、时间戳记的编年史系统，在生成过程中更新和同步内容历史。

Result: 开发了一种可用于多代理协作AI的provenance追踪系统。

Conclusion: 旨在在演变的网络生态中实现可问责的协作人工智能。

Abstract: Provenance is the chronology of things, resonating with the fundamental
pursuit to uncover origins, trace connections, and situate entities within the
flow of space and time. As artificial intelligence advances towards autonomous
agents capable of interactive collaboration on complex tasks, the provenance of
generated content becomes entangled in the interplay of collective creation,
where contributions are continuously revised, extended or overwritten. In a
multi-agent generative chain, content undergoes successive transformations,
often leaving little, if any, trace of prior contributions. In this study, we
investigates the problem of tracking multi-agent provenance across the temporal
dimension of generation. We propose a chronological system for post hoc
attribution of generative history from content alone, without reliance on
internal memory states or external meta-information. At its core lies the
notion of symbolic chronicles, representing signed and time-stamped records, in
a form analogous to the chain of custody in forensic science. The system
operates through a feedback loop, whereby each generative timestep updates the
chronicle of prior interactions and synchronises it with the synthetic content
in the very act of generation. This research seeks to develop an accountable
form of collaborative artificial intelligence within evolving cyber ecosystems.

### [8] [Embodied-R: Collaborative Framework for Activating Embodied Spatial Reasoning in Foundation Models via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12680)
*Baining Zhao,Ziyou Wang,Jianjie Fang,Chen Gao,Fanhang Man,Jinqiang Cui,Xin Wang,Xinlei Chen,Yong Li,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本篇论文介绍了Embodied-R框架，它结合大型视觉语言模型和小型语言模型，通过强化学习实现高效的空间推理，训练后在少量数据上达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练模型如何获得空间关系感知和推理能力，并开发一种计算资源有限的框架来实现高级推理。

Method: 使用Embodied-R框架，结合VLMs进行感知，small-scale LMs进行推理，通过RL和考虑逻辑一致性的奖励系统训练。

Result: 在5000个样本训练后，匹配OpenAI-o1和Gemini-2.5-pro在分布内和分布外任务上的表现，并展示出新兴的思考模式。

Conclusion: Embodied-R展示了高效的慢思考能力，并探讨了响应长度、奖励设计和训练策略等研究问题。

Abstract: Humans can perceive and reason about spatial relationships from sequential
visual observations, such as egocentric video streams. However, how pretrained
models acquire such abilities, especially high-level reasoning, remains
unclear. This paper introduces Embodied-R, a collaborative framework combining
large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for perception and small-scale
Language Models (LMs) for reasoning. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
novel reward system considering think-answer logical consistency, the model
achieves slow-thinking capabilities with limited computational resources. After
training on only 5k embodied video samples, Embodied-R with a 3B LM matches
state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning models (OpenAI-o1, Gemini-2.5-pro) on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution embodied spatial reasoning tasks.
Embodied-R also exhibits emergent thinking patterns such as systematic analysis
and contextual integration. We further explore research questions including
response length, training on VLM, strategies for reward design, and differences
in model generalization after SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and RL training.

### [9] [WebLists: Extracting Structured Information From Complex Interactive Websites Using Executable LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12682)
*Arth Bohra,Manvel Saroyan,Danil Melkozerov,Vahe Karufanyan,Gabriel Maher,Pascal Weinberger,Artem Harutyunyan,Giovanni Campagna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本论文引入WebLists基准测试，并提出BardeenAgent框架，以提升网络代理在结构化数据提取上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络代理研究主要关注导航和交易任务，而忽略大规模结构化数据提取，且现有方法表现不佳。

Method: 提出BardeenAgent框架，将代理执行转换为可重复程序，利用HTML结构构建CSS选择器进行数据提取。

Result: BardeenAgent在WebLists基准测试中达到66%的召回率，比最先进代理提高一倍，并降低成本三倍。

Conclusion: BardeenAgent有效解决了数据提取挑战，提高了性能和效率。

Abstract: Most recent web agent research has focused on navigation and transaction
tasks, with little emphasis on extracting structured data at scale. We present
WebLists, a benchmark of 200 data-extraction tasks across four common business
and enterprise use-cases. Each task requires an agent to navigate to a webpage,
configure it appropriately, and extract complete datasets with well-defined
schemas. We show that both LLMs with search capabilities and SOTA web agents
struggle with these tasks, with a recall of 3% and 31%, respectively, despite
higher performance on question-answering tasks.
  To address this challenge, we propose BardeenAgent, a novel framework that
enables web agents to convert their execution into repeatable programs, and
replay them at scale across pages with similar structure. BardeenAgent is also
the first LLM agent to take advantage of the regular structure of HTML. In
particular BardeenAgent constructs a generalizable CSS selector to capture all
relevant items on the page, then fits the operations to extract the data.
  On the WebLists benchmark, BardeenAgent achieves 66% recall overall, more
than doubling the performance of SOTA web agents, and reducing cost per output
row by 3x.

### [10] [InstructRAG: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Instruction Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13032)
*Zheng Wang,Shu Xian Teo,Jun Jie Chew,Wei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出InstructRAG框架，利用RAG和多代理元强化学习提升LLM任务规划性能，实验显示最高19.2%的改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM任务规划方法依赖TAO过程，但受限于知识不足；RAG提供外部信息支持，却面临可扩展性和可转移性挑战。

Method: 提出InstructRAG框架，包括使用图组织指令路径、RL代理增强覆盖率及ML代理提升泛化的多代理元强化学习方法。

Result: 在四个数据集上实验，InstructRAG比最佳现有方法提升高达19.2%，并高效适应新任务。

Conclusion: InstructRAG有效解决了RAG在任务规划中的关键挑战，提高了整体性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use as
agents for planning complex tasks. Existing methods typically rely on a
thought-action-observation (TAO) process to enhance LLM performance, but these
approaches are often constrained by the LLMs' limited knowledge of complex
tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers new opportunities by
leveraging external databases to ground generation in retrieved information. In
this paper, we identify two key challenges (enlargability and transferability)
in applying RAG to task planning. We propose InstructRAG, a novel solution
within a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning framework, to address these
challenges. InstructRAG includes a graph to organize past instruction paths
(sequences of correct actions), an RL-Agent with Reinforcement Learning to
expand graph coverage for enlargability, and an ML-Agent with Meta-Learning to
improve task generalization for transferability. The two agents are trained
end-to-end to optimize overall planning performance. Our experiments on four
widely used task planning datasets demonstrate that InstructRAG significantly
enhances performance and adapts efficiently to new tasks, achieving up to a
19.2% improvement over the best existing approach.

### [11] [Exploring Expert Failures Improves LLM Agent Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13145)
*Li-Cheng Lan,Andrew Bai,Minhao Cheng,Ruochen Wang,Cho-Jui Hsieh,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出EEF方法，利用专家失败轨迹中的有益行动改进LLM代理训练，显著提升性能，在WebShop中达到62%的胜率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFT方法在复杂子任务上表现不足，专家失败轨迹中含有宝贵指导信息，因此开发EEF方法。

Method: EEF从失败专家轨迹中提取有益行动，排除有害行动，并整合到训练数据中。

Result: EEF在WebShop中胜率62%，优于RFT（53.6%）和GPT-4（35.6%），在WebShop和SciWorld中设定新纪录。

Conclusion: EEF成功解决之前无法处理的子任务，并展示了利用失败经验提升代理能力的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential as agents,
excelling at tasks that require multiple rounds of reasoning and interactions.
Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as an effective method for
finetuning LLMs as agents: it first imitates expert-generated successful
trajectories and further improves agentic skills through iterative fine-tuning
on successful, self-generated trajectories. However, since the expert (e.g.,
GPT-4) succeeds primarily on simpler subtasks and RFT inherently favors simpler
scenarios, many complex subtasks remain unsolved and persistently
out-of-distribution (OOD). Upon investigating these challenging subtasks, we
discovered that previously failed expert trajectories can often provide
valuable guidance, e.g., plans and key actions, that can significantly improve
agent exploration efficiency and acquisition of critical skills. Motivated by
these observations, we propose Exploring Expert Failures (EEF), which
identifies beneficial actions from failed expert trajectories and integrates
them into the training dataset. Potentially harmful actions are meticulously
excluded to prevent contamination of the model learning process. By leveraging
the beneficial actions in expert failures, EEF successfully solves some
previously unsolvable subtasks and improves agent tuning performance.
Remarkably, our approach achieved a 62\% win rate in WebShop, outperforming RFT
(53. 6\%) and GPT-4 (35. 6\%), and to the best of our knowledge, setting a new
state-of-the-art as the first method to surpass a score of 0.81 in WebShop and
exceed 81 in SciWorld.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 反蒸馏采样通过修改概率分布毒化推理轨迹，防止模型蒸馏，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型所有者希望限制推理轨迹被用于蒸馏的漏洞，以保护模型。

Method: 战略性地修改模型的下一个令牌概率分布来毒化推理轨迹。

Result: 使推理轨迹在蒸馏中效果显著降低，同时保留模型的实际效用。

Conclusion: 反蒸馏采样提供了一种限制蒸馏有效性的方法，详情见相关网站。

Abstract: Frontier models that generate extended reasoning traces inadvertently produce
rich token sequences that can facilitate model distillation. Recognizing this
vulnerability, model owners may seek sampling strategies that limit the
effectiveness of distillation without compromising model performance.
\emph{Antidistillation sampling} provides exactly this capability. By
strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution,
antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them
significantly less effective for distillation while preserving the model's
practical utility. For further details, see https://antidistillation.com.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过创建不精确信息流模型作为可读孪生，来提升深度学习模型的可解释性，并以MNIST手写数字识别为例说明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 负责的人工智能系统需要可解释性，而深度学习模型通常不可读，因此开发转换方法以提高其可解释性。

Method: 基于数字孪生概念，引入可读孪生（不精确信息流模型），并呈现从深度学习模型到不精确信息流模型的完整转换过程。

Result: 通过MNIST数据集的图像识别例子，展示了该方法的实际应用和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为创建可解释深度学习系统提供了一种新途径，促进了负责任人工智能的发展。

Abstract: Creating responsible artificial intelligence (AI) systems is an important
issue in contemporary research and development of works on AI. One of the
characteristics of responsible AI systems is their explainability. In the
paper, we are interested in explainable deep learning (XDL) systems. On the
basis of the creation of digital twins of physical objects, we introduce the
idea of creating readable twins (in the form of imprecise information flow
models) for unreadable deep learning models. The complete procedure for
switching from the deep learning model (DLM) to the imprecise information flow
model (IIFM) is presented. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example
of a deep learning classification model for image recognition of handwritten
digits from the MNIST data set.

*Kevin Lin,Charlie Snell,Yu Wang,Charles Packer,Sarah Wooders,Ion Stoica,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出睡眠时间计算方法，通过离线预计算减少LLM测试时间计算成本，并在推理任务上实现显著优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解决LLM测试时间计算的高延迟和高成本问题，通过预测用户查询并预先计算来降低在线计算需求。

Method: 方法包括引入睡眠时间计算，修改任务如Stateful GSM-Symbolic和Stateful AIME，并开发Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic以分摊相关查询的计算。

Result: 结果显示，睡眠时间计算可减少测试时间计算约5倍，扩展计算可提高准确率最多13%和18%；多查询设置下平均查询成本减少2.5倍；查询可预测性与效果高度相关。

Conclusion: 结论是通过对实际代理任务的案例研究，验证了睡眠时间计算的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key ingredient for enabling large
language models (LLMs) to solve difficult problems, but comes with high latency
and inference cost. We introduce sleep-time compute, which allows models to
"think" offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating
what queries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, we can
significantly reduce the compute requirements at test-time. To demonstrate the
efficacy of our method, we create modified versions of two reasoning tasks -
Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. We find that sleep-time compute can
reduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~
5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time
compute we can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic
and 18% on Stateful AIME. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic,
which extends GSM-Symbolic by including multiple related queries per context.
By amortizing sleep-time compute across related queries about the same context
using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, we can decrease the average cost per query by
2.5x. We then conduct additional analysis to understand when sleep-time compute
is most effective, finding the predictability of the user query to be well
correlated with the efficacy of sleep-time compute. Finally, we conduct a
case-study of applying sleep-time compute to a realistic agentic SWE task.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts based large language models (MoE LLMs) have shown
significant promise in multitask adaptability by dynamically routing inputs to
specialized experts. Despite their success, the collaborative mechanisms among
experts are still not well understood, limiting both the interpretability and
optimization of these models. In this paper, we focus on two critical issues:
(1) identifying expert collaboration patterns, and (2) optimizing MoE LLMs
through expert pruning. To address the first issue, we propose a hierarchical
sparse dictionary learning (HSDL) method that uncovers the collaboration
patterns among experts. For the second issue, we introduce the
Contribution-Aware Expert Pruning (CAEP) algorithm, which effectively prunes
low-contribution experts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that expert
collaboration patterns are closely linked to specific input types and exhibit
semantic significance across various tasks. Moreover, pruning experiments show
that our approach improves overall performance by 2.5\% on average,
outperforming existing methods. These findings offer valuable insights into
enhancing the efficiency and interpretability of MoE LLMs, offering a clearer
understanding of expert interactions and improving model optimization.

TL;DR: 提出 aLoRA 改进 LoRA 框架，允许即时切换模型而无需重新计算 KV 缓存，提高多轮对话效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 LoRA 在多轮设置中切换时需重新计算 KV 缓存导致的低效率问题。

Method: 修改 LoRA 框架，仅为 aLoRA 激活后序列的标记适应权重，接受基础模型的 KV 缓存。

Result: aLoRA 实现了与标准 LoRA 相当的准确性，同时显著提升了推理效率。

Conclusion: aLoRA 是一种高效替代方案，启用了专业的内部模型（intrinsics）以优化模型性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for
finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to
method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly
customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a
multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the
entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation
can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which
modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the
sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA
to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can
be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the
cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly
specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an
input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We
use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive
accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization involving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problems arises in various domains. A fundamental challenge
in this context is the effective balancing of multiple objectives, each
potentially operating on very different scales. This imbalance introduces
complications such as the selection of appropriate weights when scalarizing
multiple objectives into a single objective function. In this paper, we propose
a novel technique for scaling QUBO objectives that uses an exact computation of
the variance of each individual QUBO objective. By scaling each objective to
have unit variance, we align all objectives onto a common scale, thereby
allowing for more balanced solutions to be found when scalarizing the
objectives with equal weights, as well as potentially assisting in the search
or choice of weights during scalarization. Finally, we demonstrate its
advantages through empirical evaluations on various multi-objective
optimization problems. Our results are noteworthy since manually selecting
scalarization weights is cumbersome, and reliable, efficient solutions are
scarce.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across
industries, driven by advances in deep learning and natural language
processing, and fueled by large-scale data and computing resources. Despite its
rapid adoption, the opacity of AI systems poses significant challenges to trust
and acceptance.
  This work explores the intersection of connectionist and symbolic approaches
to artificial intelligence, focusing on the derivation of interpretable
symbolic models, such as decision trees, from feedforward neural networks
(FNNs). Decision trees provide a transparent framework for elucidating the
operations of neural networks while preserving their functionality. The
derivation is presented in a step-by-step approach and illustrated with several
examples. A systematic methodology is proposed to bridge neural and symbolic
paradigms by exploiting distributed representations in FNNs to identify
symbolic components, including fillers, roles, and their interrelationships.
The process traces neuron activation values and input configurations across
network layers, mapping activations and their underlying inputs to decision
tree edges. The resulting symbolic structures effectively capture FNN decision
processes and enable scalability to deeper networks through iterative
refinement of subpaths for each hidden layer.
  To validate the theoretical framework, a prototype was developed using Keras
.h5-data and emulating TensorFlow within the Java JDK/JavaFX environment. This
prototype demonstrates the feasibility of extracting symbolic representations
from neural networks, enhancing trust in AI systems, and promoting
accountability.

Method: 生成合成数据集，使用不同空间权重矩阵和机器学习模型（如Random Forests、LightGBM等）测试，并与仅坐标模型比较，使用GeoShapley解释。

Result: 结果显示，仅使用位置坐标的机器学习模型在交叉验证R2值上优于Moran特征向量方法。

Conclusion: 适用于正空间自相关过程，但不一定适用于负自相关或网络自相关，Moran特征向量在某些场景仍有用。

Abstract: Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) approaches have shown promise in
accounting for spatial effects in statistical models. Can this extend to
machine learning? This paper examines the effectiveness of using Moran
Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. We
generate synthetic datasets with known processes involving spatially varying
and nonlinear effects across two different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors
calculated from different spatial weights matrices, with and without a priori
eigenvector selection, are tested. We assess the performance of popular machine
learning models, including Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet, and
benchmark their accuracies in terms of cross-validated R2 values against models
that use only coordinates as features. We also extract coefficients and
functions from the models using GeoShapley and compare them with the true
processes. Results show that machine learning models using only location
coordinates achieve better accuracies than eigenvector-based approaches across
various experiments and datasets. Furthermore, we discuss that while these
findings are relevant for spatial processes that exhibit positive spatial
autocorrelation, they do not necessarily apply when modeling network
autocorrelation and cases with negative spatial autocorrelation, where Moran
Eigenvectors would still be useful.

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: In recent years, fairness in machine learning has emerged as a critical
concern to ensure that developed and deployed predictive models do not have
disadvantageous predictions for marginalized groups. It is essential to
mitigate discrimination against individuals based on protected attributes such
as gender and race. In this work, we consider applying subgroup justice
concepts to gradient-boosting machines designed for supervised learning
problems. Our approach expanded gradient-boosting methodologies to explore a
broader range of objective functions, which combines conventional losses such
as the ones from classification and regression and a min-max fairness term. We
study relevant theoretical properties of the solution of the min-max
optimization problem. The optimization process explored the primal-dual
problems at each boosting round. This generic framework can be adapted to
diverse fairness concepts. The proposed min-max primal-dual gradient boosting
algorithm was theoretically shown to converge under mild conditions and
empirically shown to be a powerful and flexible approach to address binary and
subgroup fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE预训练比密集Transformer更可扩展，但稀疏反向更新导致训练不稳定和性能次优，因此需要改进路由机制。

Method: Default MoE使用指数移动平均的默认输出替代缺失专家激活，让路由器为每个标记获得所有专家信号，实现轻量级密集梯度近似。

Result: Default MoE在各种设置中优于标准TopK路由，提高训练性能且计算开销小。

Conclusion: 该方法有效稳定MoE训练，证明了通过默认输出改善稀疏激活的潜力。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) pretraining is more scalable than dense Transformer
pretraining, because MoEs learn to route inputs to a sparse set of their
feedforward parameters. However, this means that MoEs only receive a sparse
backward update, leading to training instability and suboptimal performance. We
present a lightweight approximation method that gives the MoE router a dense
gradient update while continuing to sparsely activate its parameters. Our
method, which we refer to as Default MoE, substitutes missing expert
activations with default outputs consisting of an exponential moving average of
expert outputs previously seen over the course of training. This allows the
router to receive signals from every expert for each token, leading to
significant improvements in training performance. Our Default MoE outperforms
standard TopK routing in a variety of settings without requiring significant
computational overhead. Code: https://github.com/vatsal0/default-moe.

Abstract: The intersection of deep learning and symbolic mathematics has seen rapid
progress in recent years, exemplified by the work of Lample and Charton. They
demonstrated that effective training of machine learning models for solving
mathematical problems critically depends on high-quality, domain-specific
datasets. In this paper, we address the computation of Gr\"obner basis using
Transformers. While a dataset generation method tailored to Transformer-based
Gr\"obner basis computation has previously been proposed, it lacked theoretical
guarantees regarding the generality or quality of the generated datasets. In
this work, we prove that datasets generated by the previously proposed
algorithm are sufficiently general, enabling one to ensure that Transformers
can learn a sufficiently diverse range of Gr\"obner bases. Moreover, we propose
an extended and generalized algorithm to systematically construct datasets of
ideal generators, further enhancing the training effectiveness of Transformer.
Our results provide a rigorous geometric foundation for Transformers to address
a mathematical problem, which is an answer to Lample and Charton's idea of
training on diverse or representative inputs.

Conclusion: 结论是D2FT框架有效地提高了细调效率，并能扩展到其他细调技术如LoRA。

Abstract: Fine-tuning plays a crucial role in adapting models to downstream tasks with
minimal training efforts. However, the rapidly increasing size of foundation
models poses a daunting challenge for accommodating foundation model
fine-tuning in most commercial devices, which often have limited memory
bandwidth. Techniques like model sharding and tensor parallelism address this
issue by distributing computation across multiple devices to meet memory
requirements. Nevertheless, these methods do not fully leverage their
foundation nature in facilitating the fine-tuning process, resulting in high
computational costs and imbalanced workloads. We introduce a novel Distributed
Dynamic Fine-Tuning (D2FT) framework that strategically orchestrates operations
across attention modules based on our observation that not all attention
modules are necessary for forward and backward propagation in fine-tuning
foundation models. Through three innovative selection strategies, D2FT
significantly reduces the computational workload required for fine-tuning
foundation models. Furthermore, D2FT addresses workload imbalances in
distributed computing environments by optimizing these selection strategies via
multiple knapsack optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed D2FT framework reduces the training computational costs by 40% and
training communication costs by 50% with only 1% to 2% accuracy drops on the
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Stanford Cars datasets. Moreover, the results show
that D2FT can be effectively extended to recent LoRA, a state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. By reducing 40% computational cost
or 50% communication cost, D2FT LoRA top-1 accuracy only drops 4% to 6% on
Stanford Cars dataset.

learning, and direct alignment algorithms. The book concludes with advanced
topics -- understudied research questions in synthetic data and evaluation --
and open questions for the field.

TL;DR: This paper introduces continual learning to engineering design to handle sequential data without retraining, showing improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high computational costs and the need to incorporate evolving data in engineering machine learning without catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Benchmarked several continual learning methods on regression tasks using five engineering datasets and created nine new benchmarks.

Result: Continual learning methods improved performance over baselines; the Replay strategy reduced training time by nearly half while maintaining comparable performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of continual learning for real-world engineering workflows, with code and datasets made available.

Abstract: Engineering problems that apply machine learning often involve
computationally intensive methods but rely on limited datasets. As engineering
data evolves with new designs and constraints, models must incorporate new
knowledge over time. However, high computational costs make retraining models
from scratch infeasible. Continual learning (CL) offers a promising solution by
enabling models to learn from sequential data while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, where a model forgets previously learned mappings. This work
introduces CL to engineering design by benchmarking several CL methods on
representative regression tasks. We apply these strategies to five engineering
datasets and construct nine new engineering CL benchmarks to evaluate their
ability to address forgetting and improve generalization. Preliminary results
show that applying existing CL methods to these tasks improves performance over
naive baselines. In particular, the Replay strategy achieved performance
comparable to retraining in several benchmarks while reducing training time by
nearly half, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering workflows.

Motivation: 长上下文语言模型在推理过程中GPU内存需求高，难以部署。

Method: 提出MOM方法，将关键层分区为较小的'迷你序列'，并与KV缓存卸载无缝整合。

Result: 平均减少峰值内存使用超过50%，在Meta-Llama-3.2-8B上将最大上下文长度从155k扩展到455k，且不影响准确性和吞吐量。

Conclusion: 这一突破改变了研究重点，从预填充阶段优化转向解码阶段残差KV缓存效率的提升。

Abstract: Long-context language models exhibit impressive performance but remain
challenging to deploy due to high GPU memory demands during inference. We
propose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that
partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" and integrates
seamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and
Mistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\% on
average. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k
to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and
not compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due
to minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared
to traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\% greater context
length extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill
memory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory
bottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research
priorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to
improving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.

Motivation: 探讨扩散模型如何超越训练集泛化，因为DSM目标的优化通常是训练分布的分数函数，而网络足够 expressive，但泛化机制不明朗。

Method: 开发数学理论，使用受物理启发的路径积分方法，计算欠参数化和过参数化扩散模型的学习分布。

Result: 学习到的分布类似于训练分布，但'间隙'被填充，这归因于噪声目标的协方差结构，并描述了与特征相关 inductive bias 的交互。

Conclusion: 噪声目标的 inductive bias 导致'通过方差的泛化'现象。

Abstract: How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and
is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score
matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score
function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn
the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy.
We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its
target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only
equal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent
diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory
that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our
theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to
compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and
overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion
models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions,
but with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the
covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also
characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive
biases.

Result: 实证结果显示该方法在满足未知安全定义和各种连续控制任务中有效。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且可扩展。

Abstract: In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align
the agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including
cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires
anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general
setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from
sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety
model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact
on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their
corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory
is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to
demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep.
Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and
derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally,
our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is
effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various
continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Floods are the most common form of natural disaster and accurate flood
forecasting is essential for early warning systems. Previous work has shown
that machine learning (ML) models are a promising way to improve flood
predictions when trained on large, geographically-diverse datasets. This
requirement of global training can result in a loss of ownership for national
forecasters who cannot easily adapt the models to improve performance in their
region, preventing ML models from being operationally deployed. Furthermore,
traditional hydrology research with physics-based models suggests that local
data -- which in many cases is only accessible to local agencies -- is valuable
for improving model performance. To address these concerns, we demonstrate a
methodology of pre-training a model on a large, global dataset and then
fine-tuning that model on data from individual basins. This results in
performance increases, validating our hypothesis that there is extra
information to be captured in local data. In particular, we show that
performance increases are most significant in watersheds that underperform
during global training. We provide a roadmap for national forecasters who wish
to take ownership of global models using their own data, aiming to lower the
barrier to operational deployment of ML-based hydrological forecast systems.

establishing KRR as an efficient method for building high-performance

Conclusion: EPO适用于需要平衡探索和局部优化的任务，提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off without sacrificing sample efficiency.
Policy gradient (PG) methods excel in exploitation through fine-grained,
gradient-based optimization but often struggle with exploration due to their
focus on local search. In contrast, evolutionary computation (EC) methods excel
in global exploration, but lack mechanisms for exploitation. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a
hybrid algorithm that integrates neuroevolution with policy gradient methods
for policy optimization. EPO leverages the exploration capabilities of EC and
the exploitation strengths of PG, offering an efficient solution to the
exploration-exploitation dilemma in RL. EPO is evaluated on the Atari Pong and
Breakout benchmarks. Experimental results show that EPO improves both policy
quality and sample efficiency compared to standard PG and EC methods, making it
effective for tasks that require both exploration and local optimization.

Method: 提出MagMatch框架，使用ID-Selective Magnetic（ISM）模块和Selective Magnetic Alignment（SMA）损失，选择性地对齐ID样本，不分配OOD样本原型。

Result: 实验显示MagMatch在闭集分类准确率和OOD检测AUROC上优于现有方法，尤其在泛化到未知OOD数据上。

Conclusion: MagMatch是一种有效的OSSL方法，能够显著提升性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning (OSSL) tackles the practical challenge of
learning from unlabeled data that may include both in-distribution (ID) and
unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. However, existing OSSL methods form
suboptimal feature spaces by either excluding OOD samples, interfering with
them, or overtrusting their information during training. In this work, we
introduce MagMatch, a novel framework that naturally isolates OOD samples
through a prototype-based contrastive learning paradigm. Unlike conventional
methods, MagMatch does not assign any prototypes to OOD samples; instead, it
selectively aligns ID samples with class prototypes using an ID-Selective
Magnetic (ISM) module, while allowing OOD samples - the "others" - to remain
unaligned in the feature space. To support this process, we propose Selective
Magnetic Alignment (SMA) loss for unlabeled data, which dynamically adjusts
alignment based on sample confidence. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate that MagMatch significantly outperforms existing methods in both
closed-set classification accuracy and OOD detection AUROC, especially in
generalizing to unseen OOD data.

*Leming Wu,Yaochu Jin,Kuangrong Hao,Han Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDua是一种新型联邦学习聚合方法，通过预测客户端数据量减少模型偏差，提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统加权平均方法易受客户端报告不准确数据量影响导致模型偏差的问题。

Method: 提出FedDua方法，使用本地模型梯度预测训练数据量，并可无缝集成到任何FL算法的服务器端聚合中。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实验，与四种流行方法相比，FedDua平均提高3.17%的全局模型性能。

Conclusion: FedDua有效提升FL模型性能，尤其在客户端数据量声明不准确时。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of deep learning
models without requiring data to leave local clients, thereby preserving client
privacy. The aggregation process on the server plays a critical role in the
performance of the resulting FL model. The most commonly used aggregation
method is weighted averaging based on the amount of data from each client,
which is thought to reflect each client's contribution. However, this method is
prone to model bias, as dishonest clients might report inaccurate training data
volumes to the server, which is hard to verify. To address this issue, we
propose a novel secure \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}ata
q\underline{u}antity-\underline{a}ware weighted averaging method (FedDua). It
enables FL servers to accurately predict the amount of training data from each
client based on their local model gradients uploaded. Furthermore, it can be
seamlessly integrated into any FL algorithms that involve server-side model
aggregation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarking datasets demonstrate
that FedDua improves the global model performance by an average of 3.17%
compared to four popular FL aggregation methods in the presence of inaccurate
client data volume declarations.

Result: ChemKANs无过拟合，参数少时准确模拟氢燃烧，提供2倍加速，并适用于大规模模拟。

Conclusion: ChemKANs在燃烧物理和化学动力学中有潜力，展示了KAN-ODE的可扩展性。

Abstract: Efficient chemical kinetic model inference and application for combustion
problems is challenging due to large ODE systems and wideley separated time
scales. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to streamline these
models, though strong nonlinearity and numerical stiffness combined with noisy
data sources makes their application challenging. The recently developed
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and KAN ordinary differential equations
(KAN-ODEs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for scientific applications
thanks to their rapid neural scaling, improved interpretability, and smooth
activation functions. Here, we develop ChemKANs by augmenting the KAN-ODE
framework with physical knowledge of the flow of information through the
relevant kinetic and thermodynamic laws, as well as an elemental conservation
loss term. This novel framework encodes strong inductive bias that enables
streamlined training and higher accuracy predictions, while facilitating
parameter sparsity through full sharing of information across all inputs and
outputs. In a model inference investigation, we find that ChemKANs exhibit no
overfitting or model degradation when tasked with extracting predictive models
from data that is both sparse and noisy, a task that a standard DeepONet
struggles to accomplish. Next, we find that a remarkably parameter-lean ChemKAN
(only 344 parameters) can accurately represent hydrogen combustion chemistry,
providing a 2x acceleration over the detailed chemistry in a solver that is
generalizable to larger-scale turbulent flow simulations. These demonstrations
indicate potential for ChemKANs in combustion physics and chemical kinetics,
and demonstrate the scalability of generic KAN-ODEs in significantly larger and
more numerically challenging problems than previously studied.

Result: 实验显示GroupCART在不需数据转换的情况下实现更公平的模型，并仅导致微小性能下降。

Conclusion: 结果证明，通过多任务公平性感知学习可以有效缓解决策树模型中的算法偏差。

Abstract: Discrimination-aware classification aims to make accurate predictions while
satisfying fairness constraints. Traditional decision tree learners typically
optimize for information gain in the target attribute alone, which can result
in models that unfairly discriminate against protected social groups (e.g.,
gender, ethnicity). Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose GroupCART, a
tree-based ensemble optimizer that avoids bias during model construction by
optimizing not only for decreased entropy in the target attribute but also for
increased entropy in protected attributes. Our experiments show that GroupCART
achieves fairer models without data transformation and with minimal performance
degradation. Furthermore, the method supports customizable weighting, offering
a smooth and flexible trade-off between predictive performance and fairness
based on user requirements. These results demonstrate that algorithmic bias in
decision tree models can be mitigated through multi-task, fairness-aware
learning. All code and datasets used in this study are available at:

Result: 结果显示在多种图数据集上取得显著性能提升，并在图同构性测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: 结论是这些简单修改有效，证明了其在提升Transformer图学习适用性方面的价值。

Abstract: Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities,
employing scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have
attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph
Transformers are designed with major architectural differences, either
integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention
mechanisms. These complexities prevent the easy adoption of Transformer
training advances. We propose three simple modifications to the plain
Transformer to render it applicable to graphs without introducing major
architectural distortions. Specifically, we advocate for the use of (1)
simplified $L_2$ attention to measure the magnitude closeness of tokens; (2)
adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude
information; and (3) a relative positional encoding bias with a shared encoder.
Significant performance gains across a variety of graph datasets justify the
effectiveness of our proposed modifications. Furthermore, empirical evaluation
on the expressiveness benchmark reveals noteworthy realized expressiveness in
the graph isomorphism.

Result: 实验验证显示，仅用10个样本，即可将Llama集合判断的性能估计误差降至3.37%。

Conclusion: BetaConform框架提供了理论保证的分布估计，并通过最小标记样本实现了高效估计。

Abstract: LLM ensembles are widely used for LLM judges. However, how to estimate their
accuracy, especially in an efficient way, is unknown. In this paper, we present
a principled maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for an economical and precise
estimation of the performance of LLM ensemble judgment. We first propose a
mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the judgment distribution,
revising from the vanilla Binomial distribution. Next, we introduce a conformal
prediction-driven approach that enables adaptive stopping during iterative
sampling to balance accuracy with efficiency. Furthermore, we design a prior
transfer mechanism that utilizes learned distributions on open-source datasets
to improve estimation on a target dataset when only scarce annotations are
available. Finally, we present BetaConform, a framework that integrates our
distribution assumption, adaptive stopping, and the prior transfer mechanism to
deliver a theoretically guaranteed distribution estimation of LLM ensemble
judgment with minimum labeled samples. BetaConform is also validated
empirically. For instance, with only 10 samples from the TruthfulQA dataset,
for a Llama ensembled judge, BetaConform gauges its performance with error
margin as small as 3.37%.

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery algorithms utilize many statistical tests
for conditional independence to uncover networks of causal dependencies. These
approaches to causal discovery rely on an assumed correspondence between the
graphical properties of a causal structure and the conditional independence
properties of observed variables, known as the causal Markov condition and
faithfulness. Finite data yields an empirical distribution that is "close" to
the actual distribution. Across these many possible empirical distributions,
the correspondence to the graphical properties can break down for different
conditional independencies, and multiple violations can occur at the same time.
We study this "meta-dependence" between conditional independence properties
using the following geometric intuition: each conditional independence property
constrains the space of possible joint distributions to a manifold. The
"meta-dependence" between conditional independences is informed by the position
of these manifolds relative to the true probability distribution. We provide a
simple-to-compute measure of this meta-dependence using information projections
and consolidate our findings empirically using both synthetic and real-world
data.

Motivation: 现有SGD收敛分析通常依赖Robbins-Monro条件和强假设，但实际中更广泛的步长方案被使用，而理论结果有限。

Method: 引入一个基于停止时间方法的novel分析框架。

Result: 证明了SGD迭代在步长满足∑ε_t=∞和∑ε_t^p<∞ (p>2)条件下的几乎处处收敛和L2收敛，消除了全局Lipschitz连续性假设并放宽了随机梯度高阶矩的boundedness要求。

Conclusion: 放宽的假设使理论结果更通用，提升了在实际场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is widely used in machine learning
research. Previous convergence analyses of SGD under the vanishing step-size
setting typically require Robbins-Monro conditions. However, in practice, a
wider variety of step-size schemes are frequently employed, yet existing
convergence results remain limited and often rely on strong assumptions. This
paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel analytical framework based on a
stopping-time method, enabling asymptotic convergence analysis of SGD under
more relaxed step-size conditions and weaker assumptions. In the non-convex
setting, we prove the almost sure convergence of SGD iterates for step-sizes $
\{ \epsilon_t \}_{t \geq 1} $ satisfying $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t =
+\infty$ and $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t^p < +\infty$ for some $p > 2$.
Compared with previous studies, our analysis eliminates the global Lipschitz
continuity assumption on the loss function and relaxes the boundedness
requirements for higher-order moments of stochastic gradients. Building upon
the almost sure convergence results, we further establish $L_2$ convergence.
These significantly relaxed assumptions make our theoretical results more
general, thereby enhancing their applicability in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are intricate biological systems that control
gene expression and regulation in response to environmental and developmental
cues. Advances in computational biology, coupled with high throughput

large scale omics data and uncover regulatory gene interactions. To support
both the application of GRN inference in studying gene regulation and the
development of novel machine learning methods, we present a comprehensive

the emerging role of cutting edge deep learning techniques in enhancing
inference performance. The potential future directions for improving GRN

Result: DPOSE 成功区分域内和域外样本，对未观察分子和材料类显示更高不确定性。

Conclusion: 强调轻量级 UQ 方法可提升 GNN 建模的鲁棒性，并为未来与主动学习策略整合奠定基础。

Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by
providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material
properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art
approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However,
GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data
and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge,
we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct
Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient
alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we
assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse
Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular
Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes
between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for
unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of
lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials
modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning
strategies.

Motivation: 为了提升自动驾驶车辆感知模块对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，避免分类错误导致严重后果。

Method: 使用AlexNet和VGG-16作为特征提取器，构建HCQ-DL模型，测试超过1000个量子电路，对PGD、FGSA和GA三种对抗攻击进行评估。

Result: HCQ-DL模型在无攻击场景下准确率超过95%；在GA和FGSA攻击下超过91%；在PGD攻击下，AlexNet-based模型准确率达85%，而C-DL模型低于21%。

Conclusion: HCQ-DL模型在对抗攻击下的交通标志分类准确率优于C-DL模型，提供更好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based image classification models are essential for
autonomous vehicle (AV) perception modules since incorrect categorization might
have severe repercussions. Adversarial attacks are widely studied cyberattacks
that can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output, such as incorrectly
classified traffic signs by the perception module of an autonomous vehicle. In
this study, we create and compare hybrid classical-quantum deep learning
(HCQ-DL) models with classical deep learning (C-DL) models to demonstrate
robustness against adversarial attacks for perception modules. Before feeding
them into the quantum system, we used transfer learning models, alexnet and
vgg-16, as feature extractors. We tested over 1000 quantum circuits in our
HCQ-DL models for projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack
(FGSA), and gradient attack (GA), which are three well-known untargeted
adversarial approaches. We evaluated the performance of all models during
adversarial attacks and no-attack scenarios. Our HCQ-DL models maintain
accuracy above 95\% during a no-attack scenario and above 91\% for GA and FGSA
attacks, which is higher than C-DL models. During the PGD attack, our
alexnet-based HCQ-DL model maintained an accuracy of 85\% compared to C-DL
models that achieved accuracies below 21\%. Our results highlight that the
HCQ-DL models provide improved accuracy for traffic sign classification under
adversarial settings compared to their classical counterparts.

Conclusion: FSCPU方法在聚类数据场景下提升了正未标记学习的特征选择性能，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Feature selection is essential for efficient data mining and sometimes
encounters the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning scenario, where only a few
positive labels are available, while most data remains unlabeled. In certain
real-world PU learning tasks, data subjected to adequate feature selection
often form clusters with concentrated positive labels. Conventional feature
selection methods that treat unlabeled data as negative may fail to capture the
statistical characteristics of positive data in such scenarios, leading to
suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel feature selection
method based on the cluster assumption in PU learning, called FSCPU. FSCPU
formulates the feature selection problem as a binary optimization task, with an
objective function explicitly designed to incorporate the cluster assumption in
the PU learning setting. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of FSCPU across various data conditions. Moreover, comparisons
with 10 conventional algorithms on three open datasets show that FSCPU achieves
competitive performance in downstream classification tasks, even when the
cluster assumption does not strictly hold.

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to
mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating
vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional
safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to
preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM
safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce
VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a
reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to
deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures
without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a
three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter
to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic
refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal
that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1
achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on
the SIUO benchmark.

Result: DSPR准确率达87.91%，优于现有模型；半监督策略提高20.12%准确率。

Conclusion: 提供有效风险评估方法，支持自动驾驶安全和信任提升。

Abstract: Drivers' perception of risk determines their acceptance, trust, and use of
the Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). However, perceived risk is subjective and
difficult to evaluate using existing methods. To address this issue, a driver's
subjective perceived risk (DSPR) model is proposed, regarding perceived risk as
a dynamically triggered mechanism with anisotropy and attenuation. 20
participants are recruited for a driver-in-the-loop experiment to report their
real-time subjective risk ratings (SRRs) when experiencing various automatic
driving scenarios. A convolutional neural network and bidirectional long
short-term memory network with temporal pattern attention (CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA) is
embedded into a semi-supervised learning strategy to predict SRRs, aiming to
reduce data noise caused by subjective randomness of participants. The results
illustrate that DSPR achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 87.91% in
predicting SRRs, compared to three state-of-the-art risk models. The
semi-supervised strategy improves accuracy by 20.12%. Besides, CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA
network presents the highest accuracy among four different LSTM structures.
This study offers an effective method for assessing driver's perceived risk,
providing support for the safety enhancement of ADS and driver's trust
improvement.

Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by
integrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural
network. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges
with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN
frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which
could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN
learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation
of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially
observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation
of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message
Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach
tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the
fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github
link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear
dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the
system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL
outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.

Motivation: 动机是探索顺序训练梯度下降如何克服单个任务偏向，实现联合最优解的收敛。

Result: 结果包括收敛到联合最大边际解、遗忘量随周期减少到零，以及非可分时收敛到联合损失最小值。

Conclusion: 结论是任务对齐与遗忘密切相关，循环训练可消除遗忘。

Abstract: We study continual learning on multiple linear classification tasks by
sequentially running gradient descent (GD) for a fixed budget of iterations per
task. When all tasks are jointly linearly separable and are presented in a
cyclic/random order, we show the directional convergence of the trained linear
classifier to the joint (offline) max-margin solution. This is surprising
because GD training on a single task is implicitly biased towards the
individual max-margin solution for the task, and the direction of the joint
max-margin solution can be largely different from these individual solutions.
Additionally, when tasks are given in a cyclic order, we present a
non-asymptotic analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting, revealing that (1)
alignment between tasks is indeed closely tied to catastrophic forgetting and
backward knowledge transfer and (2) the amount of forgetting vanishes to zero
as the cycle repeats. Lastly, we analyze the case where the tasks are no longer
jointly separable and show that the model trained in a cyclic order converges
to the unique minimum of the joint loss function.

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning has gained significant attention recently.
However, many existing approaches heavily depend on perturbations, and
inappropriate perturbations may corrupt the graph's inherent information. The
Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is a powerful autoencoder
extensively used in fields such as computer vision; however, its application to
graph data remains underexplored. In this paper, we provide an empirical
analysis of vector quantization in the context of graph autoencoders,
demonstrating its significant enhancement of the model's capacity to capture
graph topology. Furthermore, we identify two key challenges associated with
vector quantization when applying in graph data: codebook underutilization and
codebook space sparsity. For the first challenge, we propose an annealing-based
encoding strategy that promotes broad code utilization in the early stages of
training, gradually shifting focus toward the most effective codes as training
progresses. For the second challenge, we introduce a hierarchical two-layer
codebook that captures relationships between embeddings through clustering. The
second layer codebook links similar codes, encouraging the model to learn
closer embeddings for nodes with similar features and structural topology in
the graph. Our proposed model outperforms 16 representative baseline methods in
self-supervised link prediction and node classification tasks across multiple
datasets.

Abstract: Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF)
often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like
linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In
this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key
techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are
frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these
ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce
TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information
compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified
framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating
temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to
capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We
propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain,
supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the
learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule
can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有多标签特征选择方法只关注全局特征，忽略标签特定信息，导致性能受限，需要个性化优化。

Result: 实验在多个真实数据集上显示GPMFS性能优越，具有高可解释性和鲁棒性，并揭示标签特定强度。

Conclusion: 证明了个性化特征选择方法的必要性和潜在应用价值。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence methods are increasingly applied to complex task
scenarios, high dimensional multi-label learning has emerged as a prominent
research focus. At present, the curse of dimensionality remains one of the
major bottlenecks in high-dimensional multi-label learning, which can be
effectively addressed through multi-label feature selection methods. However,
existing multi-label feature selection methods mostly focus on identifying
global features shared across all labels, which overlooks personalized
characteristics and specific requirements of individual labels. This
global-only perspective may limit the ability to capture label-specific
discriminative information, thereby affecting overall performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and
Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection). GPMFS firstly
identifies global features by exploiting label correlations, then adaptively
supplements each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features
using a threshold-controlled strategy. Experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate that GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining
strong interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, GPMFS provides insights
into the label-specific strength across different multi-label datasets, thereby
demonstrating the necessity and potential applicability of personalized feature
selection approaches.

Result: 迭代复杂度O(1/ε²)，次线性收敛率，网络无关线性加速，无需大批量采样，实验验证有效性。

Conclusion: DEPOSITUM在理论和实际应用中表现出优越性，适用于神经网络训练。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) eliminates the reliance on the
server-client architecture inherent in traditional federated learning,
attracting significant research interest in recent years. Simultaneously, the
objective functions in machine learning tasks are often nonconvex and
frequently incorporate additional, potentially nonsmooth regularization terms
to satisfy practical requirements, thereby forming nonconvex composite
optimization problems. Employing DFL methods to solve such general optimization
problems leads to the formulation of Decentralized Nonconvex Composite
Federated Learning (DNCFL), a topic that remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we propose a novel DNCFL algorithm, termed \bf{DEPOSITUM}. Built upon
proximal stochastic gradient tracking, DEPOSITUM mitigates the impact of data
heterogeneity by enabling clients to approximate the global gradient. The
introduction of momentums in the proximal gradient descent step, replacing
tracking variables, reduces the variance introduced by stochastic gradients.
Additionally, DEPOSITUM supports local updates of client variables,
significantly reducing communication costs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that DEPOSITUM achieves an expected $\epsilon$-stationary point with an
iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. The proximal gradient,
consensus errors, and gradient estimation errors decrease at a sublinear rate
of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$. With appropriate parameter selection, the algorithm
achieves network-independent linear speedup without requiring mega-batch
sampling. Finally, we apply DEPOSITUM to the training of neural networks on
real-world datasets, systematically examining the influence of various
hyperparameters on its performance. Comparisons with other federated composite
optimization algorithms validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: Sign-In方法正交于现有方法，有助PaI，但需解决关键挑战以缩小性能差距。

Abstract: The performance gap between training sparse neural networks from scratch
(PaI) and dense-to-sparse training presents a major roadblock for efficient
deep learning. According to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, PaI hinges on
finding a problem specific parameter initialization. As we show, to this end,
determining correct parameter signs is sufficient. Yet, they remain elusive to
PaI. To address this issue, we propose Sign-In, which employs a dynamic
reparameterization that provably induces sign flips. Such sign flips are
complementary to the ones that dense-to-sparse training can accomplish,
rendering Sign-In as an orthogonal method. While our experiments and theory
suggest performance improvements of PaI, they also carve out the main open
challenge to close the gap between PaI and dense-to-sparse training.

this contributes to making swarm based optimization more transparent, robust,
and trustworthy.

Conclusion: 该方案能成功重建实际训练数据，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The loss landscape of Variational Quantum Neural Networks (VQNNs) is
characterized by local minima that grow exponentially with increasing qubits.
Because of this, it is more challenging to recover information from model
gradients during training compared to classical Neural Networks (NNs). In this
paper we present a numerical scheme that successfully reconstructs input
training, real-world, practical data from trainable VQNNs' gradients. Our
scheme is based on gradient inversion that works by combining gradients
estimation with the finite difference method and adaptive low-pass filtering.
The scheme is further optimized with Kalman filter to obtain efficient
convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm can invert even
batch-trained data, given the VQNN model is sufficiently over-parameterized.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Permutation Decision Trees (PDT)
and strategic trailing for predicting stock market movements and executing
profitable trades in the Indian stock market. We focus on high-frequency data
using 5-minute candlesticks for the top 50 stocks listed in the NIFTY 50 index.
We implement a trading strategy that aims to buy stocks at lower prices and
sell them at higher prices, capitalizing on short-term market fluctuations. Due
to regulatory constraints in India, short selling is not considered in our
strategy. The model incorporates various technical indicators and employs
hyperparameters such as the trailing stop-loss value and support thresholds to
manage risk effectively. Our results indicate that the proposed trading bot has
the potential to outperform the market average and yield returns higher than
the risk-free rate offered by 10-year Indian government bonds. We trained and
tested data on a 60 day dataset provided by Yahoo Finance. Specifically, 12
days for testing and 48 days for training. Our bot based on permutation
decision tree achieved a profit of 1.3468 % over a 12-day testing period, where
as a bot based on LSTM gave a return of 0.1238 % over a 12-day testing period
and a bot based on RNN gave a return of 0.3096 % over a 12-day testing period.
All of the bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy, which resulted in a loss
of 2.2508 %.

Result: 实验显示FedX提高量化时间至8.43倍、计算时间至1.5倍、训练时间至1.36倍，并保证模型收敛。

Conclusion: FedX高效提升联邦学习性能，验证了其优化效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training among multiple devices
without data sharing, thus enabling privacy-sensitive applications on mobile or
Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as mobile health and asset tracking.
However, designing an FL system with good model utility that works with low
computation/communication overhead on heterogeneous, resource-constrained
mobile/IoT devices is challenging. To address this problem, this paper proposes
FedX, a novel adaptive model decomposition and quantization FL system for IoT.
To balance utility with resource constraints on IoT devices, FedX decomposes a
global FL model into different sub-networks with adaptive numbers of quantized
bits for different devices. The key idea is that a device with fewer resources
receives a smaller sub-network for lower overhead but utilizes a larger number
of quantized bits for higher model utility, and vice versa. The quantization
operations in FedX are done at the server to reduce the computational load on
devices. FedX iteratively minimizes the losses in the devices' local data and
in the server's public data using quantized sub-networks under a regularization
term, and thus it maximizes the benefits of combining FL with model
quantization through knowledge sharing among the server and devices in a
cost-effective training process. Extensive experiments show that FedX
significantly improves quantization times by up to 8.43X, on-device computation
time by 1.5X, and total end-to-end training time by 1.36X, compared with
baseline FL systems. We guarantee the global model convergence theoretically
and validate local model convergence empirically, highlighting FedX's
optimization efficiency.

Conclusion: Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe是处理不平衡数据集的强有力方法，强调噪声减少和异常值处理。

Abstract: Classifying imbalanced datasets remains a significant challenge in machine
learning, particularly with big data where instances are unevenly distributed
among classes, leading to class imbalance issues that impact classifier
performance. While Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) addresses
this challenge by generating new instances for the under-represented minority
class, it faces obstacles in the form of noise and outliers during the creation
of new samples. In this paper, a proposed approach, iHHO-SMOTe, which addresses
the limitations of SMOTE by first cleansing the data from noise points. This
process involves employing feature selection using a random forest to identify
the most valuable features, followed by applying the Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect outliers
based on the selected features. The identified outliers from the minority
classes are then removed, creating a refined dataset for subsequent
oversampling using the hybrid approach called iHHO-SMOTe. The comprehensive
experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of
the proposed model, with an AUC score exceeding 0.99, a high G-means score of
0.99 highlighting its robustness, and an outstanding F1-score consistently
exceeding 0.967. These findings collectively establish Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe as a
formidable contender in addressing imbalanced datasets, focusing on noise
reduction and outlier handling for improved classification models.

Motivation: 揭示联邦学习中非独立同分布数据导致的漏洞，这些漏洞使模型易受投毒攻击。

Method: 开发CollaPois攻击，通过将感染木马的模型分发给受损客户端，协作产生恶意梯度。

Result: CollaPois优于现有攻击，绕过防御，仅需少量受损客户端即可生效；数据相似的客户端风险更高。

Conclusion: 证明了在非独立同分布场景下，联邦学习需要改进防御措施。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training using
decentralized private data from multiple clients. While FL has shown robustness
against poisoning attacks with basic defenses, our research reveals new
vulnerabilities stemming from non-independent and identically distributed
(non-IID) data among clients. These vulnerabilities pose a substantial risk of
model poisoning in real-world FL scenarios.
  To demonstrate such vulnerabilities, we develop a novel collaborative
backdoor poisoning attack called CollaPois. In this attack, we distribute a
single pre-trained model infected with a Trojan to a group of compromised
clients. These clients then work together to produce malicious gradients,
causing the FL model to consistently converge towards a low-loss region
centered around the Trojan-infected model. Consequently, the impact of the
Trojan is amplified, especially when the benign clients have diverse local data
distributions and scattered local gradients. CollaPois stands out by achieving
its goals while involving only a limited number of compromised clients, setting
it apart from existing attacks. Also, CollaPois effectively avoids noticeable
shifts or degradation in the FL model's performance on legitimate data samples,
allowing it to operate stealthily and evade detection by advanced robust FL
algorithms.
  Thorough theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on various benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of CollaPois compared to state-of-the-art
backdoor attacks. Notably, CollaPois bypasses existing backdoor defenses,
especially in scenarios where clients possess diverse data distributions.
Moreover, the results show that CollaPois remains effective even when involving
a small number of compromised clients. Notably, clients whose local data is
closely aligned with compromised clients experience higher risks of backdoor
infections.

Method: 引入在BirdSet上预训练的Bird-MAE，探索预训练、微调、冻结表示，并提出原型探测方法。

Result: Bird-MAE在BirdSet任务上达到最先进结果，多标签分类性能显著提升；原型探测比线性探测提高最多37%的MAP，平均缩小与微调差距至3%。

Conclusion: 领域专用MAE有效，原型探测是一种参数高效的方法。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) pretrained on AudioSet fail to capture the
fine-grained acoustic characteristics of specialized domains such as
bioacoustic monitoring. Bird sound classification is critical for assessing
environmental health, yet general-purpose models inadequately address its
unique acoustic challenges. To address this, we introduce Bird-MAE, a
domain-specialized MAE pretrained on the large-scale BirdSet dataset. We
explore adjustments to pretraining, fine-tuning and utilizing frozen
representations. Bird-MAE achieves state-of-the-art results across all BirdSet
downstream tasks, substantially improving multi-label classification
performance compared to the general-purpose Audio-MAE baseline. Additionally,
we propose prototypical probing, a parameter-efficient method for leveraging
MAEs' frozen representations. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear
probing by up to 37\% in MAP and narrow the gap to fine-tuning to approximately
3\% on average on BirdSet.

Result: 展示了洞见的实用性，并证明关闭权重衰减可提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: 利用正则化的持久效果，动态权重衰减调度可改善模型泛化。

Abstract: Implicit bias plays an important role in explaining how overparameterized
models generalize well. Explicit regularization like weight decay is often
employed in addition to prevent overfitting. While both concepts have been
studied separately, in practice, they often act in tandem. Understanding their
interplay is key to controlling the shape and strength of implicit bias, as it
can be modified by explicit regularization. To this end, we incorporate
explicit regularization into the mirror flow framework and analyze its lasting
effects on the geometry of the training dynamics, covering three distinct
effects: positional bias, type of bias, and range shrinking. Our analytical
approach encompasses a broad class of problems, including sparse coding, matrix
sensing, single-layer attention, and LoRA, for which we demonstrate the utility
of our insights. To exploit the lasting effect of regularization and highlight
the potential benefit of dynamic weight decay schedules, we propose to switch
off weight decay during training, which can improve generalization, as we
demonstrate in experiments.

leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops,
including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation
laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning
behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology
extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired
macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them
to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in
attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular
arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and
theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.

Abstract: We propose a new unsupervised anomaly detection method based on the
sliced-Wasserstein distance for training data selection in machine learning
approaches. Our filtering technique is interesting for decision-making
pipelines deploying machine learning models in critical sectors, e.g., power
systems, as it offers a conservative data selection and an optimal transport
interpretation. To ensure the scalability of our method, we provide two
efficient approximations. The first approximation processes reduced-cardinality
representations of the datasets concurrently. The second makes use of a
computationally light Euclidian distance approximation. Additionally, we open
the first dataset showcasing localized critical peak rebate demand response in
a northern climate. We present the filtering patterns of our method on
synthetic datasets and numerically benchmark our method for training data
selection. Finally, we employ our method as part of a first forecasting
benchmark for our open-source dataset.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of using wrist-worn inertial sensors to
automate the labeling of ARAT (Action Research Arm Test) items. While the ARAT
is commonly used to assess upper limb motor function, its limitations include
subjectivity and time consumption of clinical staff. By using IMU (Inertial

technique, this investigation aims to classify ARAT items based on sensor
recordings. We test common preprocessing strategies to efficiently leverage
included information in the data. Afterward, we use the best preprocessing to
improve the classification. The dataset includes recordings of 45 participants
performing various ARAT items. Results show that MiniROCKET offers a fast and
reliable approach for classifying ARAT domains, although challenges remain in
distinguishing between individual resembling items. Future work may involve
improving classification through more advanced machine-learning models and data
enhancements.

TL;DR: 本论文提出RL-PINNs，使用强化学习优化PINNs的自适应采样，提高PDE求解效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PINNs的自适应采样方法计算效率低下，需要多次采样和重训练，因此需开发更高效的采样策略。

Method: 提出RL-PINNs框架，将采样建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用函数变异作为奖励信号，并采用延迟奖励机制。

Result: 实验显示RL-PINNs在各种PDE基准测试中准确性优于传统方法，且采样开销小，适用于高维和高阶问题。

Conclusion: RL-PINNs是一种高效、可扩展的PINNs训练方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their performance
heavily relies on the strategy used to select training points. Conventional
adaptive sampling methods, such as residual-based refinement, often require
multi-round sampling and repeated retraining of PINNs, leading to computational
inefficiency due to redundant points and costly gradient
computations-particularly in high-dimensional or high-order derivative
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose RL-PINNs, a reinforcement
learning(RL)-driven adaptive sampling framework that enables efficient training
with only a single round of sampling. Our approach formulates adaptive sampling
as a Markov decision process, where an RL agent dynamically selects optimal
training points by maximizing a long-term utility metric. Critically, we
replace gradient-dependent residual metrics with a computationally efficient
function variation as the reward signal, eliminating the overhead of derivative
calculations. Furthermore, we employ a delayed reward mechanism to prioritize
long-term training stability over short-term gains. Extensive experiments
across diverse PDE benchmarks, including low-regular, nonlinear,
high-dimensional, and high-order problems, demonstrate that RL-PINNs
significantly outperforms existing residual-driven adaptive methods in
accuracy. Notably, RL-PINNs achieve this with negligible sampling overhead,
making them scalable to high-dimensional and high-order problems.

have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and
across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad
architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding
up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can
be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.

Conclusion: 该虚拟机为低精度计算提供高效支持，提升了LLM应用的资源利用率。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications
but demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory
bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged
as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption.
Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight
bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance due to
high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical
optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory
access patterns, which are essential for efficient low-precision computations.
In this paper, we introduce a virtual machine (VM) designed for General-Purpose
GPU (GPGPU) computing, enabling support for low-precision data types with
arbitrary bit widths while maintaining GPU programmability. The proposed VM
features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a
novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision
data types. VM programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs with
automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VM efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision
data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels on their
supported types. Compared to existing compilers like Triton and Ladder, as well
as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, our VM achieves
performance improvements of 1.75x, 2.61x, 1.29x and 1.03x, respectively.

<details>

Motivation: 现有L2D方法仅支持单代理推迟，但在高风险场景中需要集体专业知识，因此需开发更灵活的分配机制。

Method: 提出Top-k和Top-k(x)框架，导出一个新的Bayes一致代理损失，并证明其一致性，同时展示了与模型级联范式的关联。

Result: 实验在多种基准上验证了框架在分类和回归任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了决策系统的可靠性和成本效率，并作为集体专业知识应用的通用方法。

Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables decision-making systems to improve
reliability by selectively deferring uncertain predictions to more competent
agents. However, most existing approaches focus exclusively on single-agent
deferral, which is often inadequate in high-stakes scenarios that require
collective expertise. We propose Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer, a generalization of
the classical two-stage L2D framework that allocates each query to the $k$ most
confident agents instead of a single one. To further enhance flexibility and
cost-efficiency, we introduce Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer, an adaptive
extension that learns the optimal number of agents to consult for each query,
based on input complexity, agent competency distributions, and consultation
costs. For both settings, we derive a novel surrogate loss and prove that it is
Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent, ensuring
convergence to the Bayes-optimal allocation. Notably, we show that the
well-established model cascades paradigm arises as a restricted instance of our
Top-$k$ and Top-$k(x)$ formulations. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both
classification and regression tasks.

Motivation: 探讨CoT提示在分布偏移下的泛化能力，因为这一领域仍不为人所理解。

Method: 扩展了CoT提示的潜变量框架，并研究了两种OOD场景：潜变量的排列组合和统一缩放。

Result: 实验显示，CoT推理在OOD样本的潜变量与训练时相似的条件下泛化良好，但相似度降低时性能下降。

Conclusion: 提供了CoT提示在OOD条件下的优势和局限性洞见，并为未来LLM开发更具弹性的推理策略指出了方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique to
improve in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) by breaking
complex reasoning into intermediate steps. However, the ability of CoT to
generalize under distribution shift remains poorly understood. In this work, we
extend a latent-variable framework for CoT prompting and study its behavior on
two prototypical out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios: (i) the latent variables
for CoT steps are permuted into novel combinations, and (ii) the latent
variables uniformly scaled by a factor. Our experiments demonstrate that CoT
inference generalizes effectively to OOD samples whose latent variables closely
resemble those seen during training, but its performance degrades as this
similarity decreases. These findings provide foundational insights into the
strengths and limitations of CoT prompting under OOD conditions and suggest
directions for developing more resilient reasoning strategies in future LLMs.

Result: 实验在多种大规模图上验证了方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: IFGC能显著加速GNNs推理，同时保持推理质量。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph
analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering
their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly
graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs
inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed
graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that
the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little
decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference
equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not
distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical
specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving
compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN
inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a
configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and
anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of
interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms
with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct
extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the
effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.

Result: APM通过监督微调提升性能，并在某些任务中支持零样本采样，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: APM展示了在下游应用的通用性，并计划开源代码，促进多链蛋白研究进展。

Abstract: Proteins typically exist in complexes, interacting with other proteins or
biomolecules to perform their specific biological roles. Research on
single-chain protein modeling has been extensively and deeply explored, with
advancements seen in models like the series of ESM and AlphaFold. Despite these
developments, the study and modeling of multi-chain proteins remain largely
uncharted, though they are vital for understanding biological functions.
Recognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (All-Atom
Protein Generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling
multi-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data
on multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain
interactions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from
scratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain
proteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it
achieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also
supporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results. Code will be released at https://github.com/bytedance/apm.

Motivation: 自监督学习设计空间扩大，但PRH缺乏精确理论解释，需要扩展理论框架以理解其经验成功。

Method: 综合可识别性理论（IT）的证据，提出扩展为奇异可识别性理论（SITh），涵盖整个自监督学习管道。

Result: 证明PRH在自监督学习中可能出现，但当前IT无法解释经验成功；SITh提供更广泛框架以提升洞见。

Conclusion: SITh能加深对隐式数据假设的理解，推进可解释和泛化表示的发展，并强调三个未来研究方向：训练动态、有限样本影响及归纳偏差的作用。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research
interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The
Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH),
suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all
representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon
lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from
Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However,
current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between
theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular
Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the
entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data
assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable
and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for
future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the
impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of
inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and
optimizers.

Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising
capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their
out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge,
particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to
ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral
Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that
uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors
derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory
prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic
spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels,
which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as
stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation
framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the
nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios,
demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In
particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where
uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page:

Abstract: While convolution and self-attention mechanisms have dominated architectural
design in deep learning, this survey examines a fundamental yet understudied
primitive: the Hadamard product. Despite its widespread implementation across
various applications, the Hadamard product has not been systematically analyzed
as a core architectural primitive. We present the first comprehensive taxonomy
of its applications in deep learning, identifying four principal domains:
higher-order correlation, multimodal data fusion, dynamic representation
modulation, and efficient pairwise operations. The Hadamard product's ability
to model nonlinear interactions with linear computational complexity makes it
particularly valuable for resource-constrained deployments and edge computing
scenarios. We demonstrate its natural applicability in multimodal fusion tasks,
such as visual question answering, and its effectiveness in representation
masking for applications including image inpainting and pruning. This
systematic review not only consolidates existing knowledge about the Hadamard
product's role in deep learning architectures but also establishes a foundation
for future architectural innovations. Our analysis reveals the Hadamard product
as a versatile primitive that offers compelling trade-offs between
computational efficiency and representational power, positioning it as a
crucial component in the deep learning toolkit.

Abstract: Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) has been the focus of a successful eradication
programme in Ireland, with the herd-level prevalence declining from 11.3% in
2013 to just 0.2% in 2023. As the country moves toward BVD freedom, the
development of predictive models for targeted surveillance becomes increasingly
important to mitigate the risk of disease re-emergence. In this study, we
evaluate the performance of a range of machine learning algorithms, including
binary classification and anomaly detection techniques, for predicting
BVD-positive herds using highly imbalanced herd-level data. We conduct an
extensive simulation study to assess model performance across varying sample
sizes and class imbalance ratios, incorporating resampling, class weighting,
and appropriate evaluation metrics (sensitivity, positive predictive value,
F1-score and AUC values). Random forests and XGBoost models consistently
outperformed other methods, with the random forest model achieving the highest
sensitivity and AUC across scenarios, including real-world prediction of 2023
herd status, correctly identifying 219 of 250 positive herds while halving the
number of herds that require compared to a blanket-testing strategy.

Result: 在真实葡萄品种数据上，TAL框架提升了冷硬度预测准确性。

Conclusion: TAL框架有效利用phenological数据，提供更好农业决策支持。

Abstract: Cold temperatures can cause significant frost damage to fruit crops depending
on their resilience, or cold hardiness, which changes throughout the dormancy
season. This has led to the development of predictive cold-hardiness models,
which help farmers decide when to deploy expensive frost-mitigation measures.
Unfortunately, cold-hardiness data for model training is only available for
some fruit cultivars due to the need for specialized equipment and expertise.
Rather, farmers often do have years of phenological data (e.g. date of
budbreak) that they regularly collect for their crops. In this work, we
introduce a new transfer-learning framework, Transfer via Auxiliary Labels
(TAL), that allows farmers to leverage the phenological data to produce more
accurate cold-hardiness predictions, even when no cold-hardiness data is
available for their specific crop. The framework assumes a set of source tasks
(cultivars) where each has associated primary labels (cold hardiness) and
auxiliary labels (phenology). However, the target task (new cultivar) is
assumed to only have the auxiliary labels. The goal of TAL is to predict
primary labels for the target task via transfer from the source tasks.
Surprisingly, despite the vast literature on transfer learning, to our
knowledge, the TAL formulation has not been previously addressed. Thus, we
propose several new TAL approaches based on model selection and averaging that
can leverage recent deep multi-task models for cold-hardiness prediction. Our
results on real-world cold-hardiness and phenological data for multiple grape
cultivars demonstrate that TAL can leverage the phenological data to improve
cold-hardiness predictions in the absence of cold-hardiness data.

Motivation: 为了建立有意义的评价标准，确保新机制解释性方法的改进是真实的。

Method: 提出MIB基准，包括电路定位和因果变量定位两个轨道，通过比较多种方法（如归因修补、稀疏自动编码器和分布式对齐搜索）在不同任务和模型上的表现。

Result: 在电路定位中，归因和掩码优化方法表现最佳；在因果变量定位中，监督分布式对齐搜索方法最佳，而稀疏自动编码器特征不优于神经元。

Conclusion: MIB基准能实现方法间的有意义比较，并增强了对该领域取得真实进展的信心。

Abstract: How can we know whether new mechanistic interpretability methods achieve real
improvements? In pursuit of meaningful and lasting evaluation standards, we
propose MIB, a benchmark with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models.
MIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal
pathways or specific causal variables in neural language models. The circuit
localization track compares methods that locate the model components - and
connections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g.,
attribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable
localization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g.,
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and locate
model features for a causal variable relevant to the task. Using MIB, we find
that attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit
localization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS
method performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e.,
standard dimensions of hidden vectors. These findings illustrate that MIB
enables meaningful comparisons of methods, and increases our confidence that
there has been real progress in the field.

Conclusion: 该方法为设计高效神经架构提供新途径，提升基础模型性能。

Abstract: Designing efficient and effective architectural backbones has been in the
core of research efforts to enhance the capability of foundation models.
Inspired by the human cognitive phenomenon of attentional bias-the natural
tendency to prioritize certain events or stimuli-we reconceptualize neural
architectures, including Transformers, Titans, and modern linear recurrent
neural networks as associative memory modules that learn a mapping of keys and
values using an internal objective, referred to as attentional bias.
Surprisingly, we observed that most existing sequence models leverage either
(1) dot-product similarity, or (2) L2 regression objectives as their
attentional bias. Going beyond these objectives, we present a set of
alternative attentional bias configurations along with their effective
approximations to stabilize their training procedure. We then reinterpret
forgetting mechanisms in modern deep learning architectures as a form of
retention regularization, providing a novel set of forget gates for sequence
models. Building upon these insights, we present Miras, a general framework to
design deep learning architectures based on four choices of: (i) associative
memory architecture, (ii) attentional bias objective, (iii) retention gate, and
(iv) memory learning algorithm. We present three novel sequence models-Moneta,
Yaad, and Memora-that go beyond the power of existing linear RNNs while
maintaining a fast parallelizable training process. Our experiments show
different design choices in Miras yield models with varying strengths. For
example, certain instances of Miras achieve exceptional performance in special
tasks such as language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and recall intensive
tasks, even outperforming Transformers and other modern linear recurrent
models.

Result: 方法使93%的草图完全约束，优于监督微调基线的34%和无校准的8.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于任何约束生成模型，并为语言和设计领域校准策略的进一步研究奠定基础。

Abstract: We adapt alignment techniques from reasoning LLMs to the task of generating
engineering sketch constraints found in computer-aided design (CAD) models.
Engineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines)
connected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the
relationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints
must effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates
predictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate
CAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design
intent, we label this problem `design alignment'. A critical first step towards
aligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain
all geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch
geometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation
model with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain
93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a na\"ive supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without alignment. Our approach can be applied to
any existing constraint generation model and sets the stage for further
research bridging alignment strategies between the language and design domains.

Abstract: High-stakes domains like cyber operations need responsible and trustworthy AI
methods. While large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular
in these domains, they still suffer from hallucinations. This research paper
provides learning outcomes from a case study with LinkQ, an open-source natural
language interface that was developed to combat hallucinations by forcing an
LLM to query a knowledge graph (KG) for ground-truth data during
question-answering (QA). We conduct a quantitative evaluation of LinkQ using a
well-known KGQA dataset, showing that the system outperforms GPT-4 but still
struggles with certain question categories - suggesting that alternative query
construction strategies will need to be investigated in future LLM querying
systems. We discuss a qualitative study of LinkQ with two domain experts using
a real-world cybersecurity KG, outlining these experts' feedback, suggestions,
perceived limitations, and future opportunities for systems like LinkQ.

Motivation: 当前LLMs翻译XAI输出可能导致用户过度依赖和可解释性假象，因此需要改进以提升透明度。

Method: 论文提出LLMs应主动呈现替代解释、偏差、数据限制和推理失效案例，来质疑XAI输出。

Result: 这种方法可减少过度依赖，帮助用户批判性互动AI系统。

Conclusion: LLMs应作为建设性质疑者，增强XAI的真实透明性。

Abstract: This position paper highlights a growing trend in Explainable AI (XAI)
research where Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to translate outputs from
explainability techniques, like feature-attribution weights, into a natural
language explanation. While this approach may improve accessibility or
readability for users, recent findings suggest that translating into human-like
explanations does not necessarily enhance user understanding and may instead
lead to overreliance on AI systems. When LLMs summarize XAI outputs without
surfacing model limitations, uncertainties, or inconsistencies, they risk
reinforcing the illusion of interpretability rather than fostering meaningful
transparency. We argue that - instead of merely translating XAI outputs - LLMs
should serve as constructive agitators, or devil's advocates, whose role is to
actively interrogate AI explanations by presenting alternative interpretations,
potential biases, training data limitations, and cases where the model's
reasoning may break down. In this role, LLMs can facilitate users in engaging
critically with AI systems and generated explanations, with the potential to
reduce overreliance caused by misinterpreted or specious explanations.

Result: 识别四种AI写作支持设计策略，映射到写作的认知过程；揭示作家偏好因领域和上下文而异。

Conclusion: 为开发以人为本的AI写作工具提供可操作的设计指导。

Abstract: As generative AI tools like ChatGPT become integral to everyday writing,
critical questions arise about how to preserve writers' sense of agency and
ownership when using these tools. Yet, a systematic understanding of how AI
assistance affects different aspects of the writing process - and how this
shapes writers' agency - remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conducted a systematic review of 109 HCI papers using the PRISMA approach. From
this literature, we identify four overarching design strategies for AI writing
support: structured guidance, guided exploration, active co-writing, and
critical feedback - mapped across the four key cognitive processes in writing:
planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. We complement this analysis
with interviews of 15 writers across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that
writers' desired levels of AI intervention vary across the writing process:
content-focused writers (e.g., academics) prioritize ownership during planning,
while form-focused writers (e.g., creatives) value control over translating and
reviewing. Writers' preferences are also shaped by contextual goals, values,
and notions of originality and authorship. By examining when ownership matters,
what writers want to own, and how AI interactions shape agency, we surface both
alignment and gaps between research and user needs. Our findings offer
actionable design guidance for developing human-centered writing tools for
co-writing with AI, on human terms.

Abstract: In this paper, we advance the study of AI-augmented reasoning in the context
of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), psychology and cognitive science, focusing
on the critical task of visual perception. Specifically, we investigate the
applicability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain. To
this end, we leverage established principles and explanations from psychology
and cognitive science related to complexity in human visual perception. We use
them as guiding principles for the MLLMs to compare and interprete visual
content. Our study aims to benchmark MLLMs across various explainability
principles relevant to visual perception. Unlike recent approaches that
primarily employ advanced deep learning models to predict complexity metrics
from visual content, our work does not seek to develop a mere new predictive
model. Instead, we propose a novel annotation-free analytical framework to
assess utility of MLLMs as cognitive assistants for HCI tasks, using visual
perception as a case study. The primary goal is to pave the way for principled
study in quantifying and evaluating the interpretability of MLLMs for
applications in improving human reasoning capability and uncovering biases in
existing perception datasets annotated by humans.

Method: 提出结合分散式群集学习框架和基于可信度权重的模型合并机制的群集电池管理系统。

Result: 在数据平衡、体积偏差、特征偏差和质量偏差场景下，群集学习提升了估计准确性，与使用大量数据的中心学习相当。

Conclusion: 群集学习框架在数据有限情况下有效提高电池容量估计准确性，同时维护数据隐私和安全。

Abstract: Data-driven methods have shown potential in electric-vehicle battery
management tasks such as capacity estimation, but their deployment is
bottlenecked by poor performance in data-limited scenarios. Sharing battery
data among algorithm developers can enable accurate and generalizable
data-driven models. However, an effective battery management framework that
simultaneously ensures data privacy and fault tolerance is still lacking. This
paper proposes a swarm battery management system that unites a decentralized
swarm learning (SL) framework and credibility weight-based model merging
mechanism to enhance battery capacity estimation in data-limited scenarios
while ensuring data privacy and security. The effectiveness of the SL framework
is validated on a dataset comprising 66 commercial LiNiCoAlO2 cells cycled
under various operating conditions. Specifically, the capacity estimation
performance is validated in four cases, including data-balanced, volume-biased,
feature-biased, and quality-biased scenarios. Our results show that SL can
enhance the estimation accuracy in all data-limited cases and achieve a similar
level of accuracy with central learning where large amounts of data are
available.

Method: 将本地经济指标内生地纳入电力系统规划模型，构建本地供应和边际收益曲线，并使用多目标优化框架最小化成本和最大化经济收益。

Conclusion: 强调在太阳能规划中整合经济考虑，以更好地协调脱碳目标与本地经济发展。

Abstract: The Midwest, with its vast agricultural lands, is rapidly emerging as a key
region for utility-scale solar expansion. However, traditional power planning
has yet to integrate local economic impact directly into capacity expansion to
guide optimal siting decisions. Moreover, existing economic assessments tend to
emphasize local benefits while overlooking the opportunity costs of converting
productive farmland for solar development. This study addresses these gaps by
endogenously incorporating local economic metrics into a power system planning
model to evaluate how economic impacts influence solar siting, accounting for
the cost of lost agricultural output. We analyze all counties within the Great
Lakes region, constructing localized supply and marginal benefit curves that
are embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at
minimizing system costs and maximizing community economic benefits. Our
findings show that counties with larger economies and lower farmland
productivity deliver the highest local economic benefit per megawatt (MW) of
installed solar capacity. In Ohio, for example, large counties generate up to
$34,500 per MW, driven in part by high property tax revenues, while smaller
counties yield 31% less. Accounting for the opportunity cost of displaced
agricultural output reduces local benefits by up to 16%, depending on farmland
quality. A scenario prioritizing solar investment in counties with higher
economic returns increases total economic benefits by $1 billion (or 11%) by
2040, with solar investment shifting away from Michigan and Wisconsin (down by
39%) toward Ohio and Indiana (up by 75%), with only a marginal increase of 0.5%
in system-wide costs. These findings underscore the importance of integrating
economic considerations into utility-scale solar planning to better align
decarbonization goals with regional and local economic development.

Conclusion: 该方法减少了对先验知识的依赖，提高了Kalman滤波的准确性、稳健性和效率。

Abstract: Kalman filtering can provide an optimal estimation of the system state from
noisy observation data. This algorithm's performance depends on the accuracy of
system modeling and noise statistical characteristics, which are usually
challenging to obtain in practical applications. The powerful nonlinear
modeling capabilities of deep learning, combined with its ability to extract
features from large amounts of data automatically, offer new opportunities for
improving the Kalman filter. This paper proposes a novel method that leverages
the Spiking Neural Network to optimize the Kalman filter. Our approach aims to
reduce the reliance on prior knowledge of system and observation noises,
allowing for adaptation to varying statistical characteristics of time-varying
noise. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of SNNs in improving the
computational efficiency of the Kalman filter. In our method, we design an
integration strategy between the SNN and the Kalman filter. The SNN is trained
to directly approximate the optimal gain matrix from observation data, thereby
alleviating the computational burden of complex matrix operations inherent in
traditional Kalman filtering while maintaining the accuracy and robustness of
state estimation. Its average error has been reduced by 18\%-65\% compared with
other methods.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel state estimation framework that incorporates
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) into Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE), shifting from
traditional physics-based models to rapidly developed data-driven techniques. A
DNN model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) nodes is trained on synthetic data
generated by a high-fidelity thermal model of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Machine (PMSM), which undergoes thermal derating as part of the torque control
strategy in a battery electric vehicle. The MHE is constructed by integrating
the trained DNN with a simplified driving dynamics model in a discrete-time
formulation, incorporating the LSTM hidden and cell states in the state vector
to retain system dynamics. The resulting optimal control problem (OCP) is
formulated as a nonlinear program (NLP) and implemented using the acados
framework. Model-in-the-loop (MiL) simulations demonstrate accurate temperature
estimation, even under noisy sensor conditions or failures. Achieving threefold
real-time capability on embedded hardware confirms the feasibility of the
approach for practical deployment. The primary focus of this study is to assess
the feasibility of the MHE framework using a DNN-based plant model instead of
focusing on quantitative comparisons of vehicle performance. Overall, this
research highlights the potential of DNN-based MHE for real-time,
safety-critical applications by combining the strengths of model-based and

Conclusion: 框架成功提高了碳效率和用户市场参与度。

Abstract: The integration of renewable energy resources (RES) in the power grid can
reduce carbon intensity, but also presents certain challenges. The uncertainty
and intermittent nature of RES emphasize the need for flexibility in power
systems. Moreover, there are noticeable mismatches between real-time
electricity prices and carbon intensity patterns throughout the day. These
discrepancies may lead customers to schedule energy-intensive tasks during the
early hours of the day, a period characterized by lower electricity prices but
higher carbon intensity. This paper introduces a novel and comprehensive
framework aimed at encouraging customer participation in electricity markets
and aligning their flexibility with carbon intensity trends. The proposed
approach integrates an incentive-based tariff with a tri-level optimization
model, where customers are motivated to submit flexibility bids and, in return,
receive financial rewards based on their contributions. The tri-level model
ensures a dynamic interaction between the market operation platform (MOP) and
end-users. Simulations are performed on a modified IEEE-33 bus system,
supported by two scenarios with different RES generations and customer
behaviors. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in
guiding the customers' consumption behaviors towards low carbon intensity.

Abstract: This tutorial paper focuses on safe physics-informed machine learning in the

integrate physical models and safety guarantees. As machine learning techniques
enhance the modeling and control of complex dynamical systems, ensuring safety
and stability remains a critical challenge, especially in safety-critical
applications like autonomous vehicles, robotics, medical decision-making, and
energy systems. We explore various approaches for embedding and ensuring safety
constraints, such as structural priors, Lyapunov functions, Control Barrier
Functions, predictive control, projections, and robust optimization techniques,
ensuring that the learned models respect stability and safety criteria.
Additionally, we delve into methods for uncertainty quantification and safety
verification, including reachability analysis and neural network verification
tools, which help validate that control policies remain within safe operating
bounds even in uncertain environments. The paper includes illustrative examples
demonstrating the implementation aspects of safe learning frameworks that
combine the strengths of data-driven approaches with the rigor of physical

Result: 與通用方法相比，展示了更好的性能和效率。

Conclusion: 通過整合領域知識和語言特定方法，提高了銀行交易分類的性能。

Abstract: With the introduction of the PSD2 regulation in the EU which established the
Open Banking framework, a new window of opportunities has opened for banks and
fintechs to explore and enrich Bank transaction descriptions with the aim of
building a better understanding of customer behavior, while using this
understanding to prevent fraud, reduce risks and offer more competitive and
tailored services.
  And although the usage of natural language processing models and techniques
has seen an incredible progress in various applications and domains over the
past few years, custom applications based on domain-specific text corpus remain
unaddressed especially in the banking sector.
  In this paper, we introduce a language-based Open Banking transaction
classification system with a focus on the french market and french language
text. The system encompasses data collection, labeling, preprocessing,
modeling, and evaluation stages. Unlike previous studies that focus on general
classification approaches, this system is specifically tailored to address the
challenges posed by training a language model with a specialized text corpus
(Banking data in the French context). By incorporating language-specific
techniques and domain knowledge, the proposed system demonstrates enhanced
performance and efficiency compared to generic approaches.

### [95] [SimUSER: Simulating User Behavior with Large Language Models for Recommender System Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12722)
*Nicolas Bougie,Narimasa Watanabe*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 简而言之，SimUSER 是一个模拟人类代理的框架，用于评估推荐系统，提高离线和在线性能的匹配度，并通过实验改进真实世界用户参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统的性能评估面临挑战，因为离线指标与在线行为不一致，且真实用户数据稀缺且受隐私限制。

Method: 引入 SimUSER 框架，首先从历史数据中识别自洽的人设，丰富用户配置文件，然后通过配备人设、记忆、感知和大脑模块的代理与推荐系统互动。

Result: SimUSER 与真实人类行为更接近，在微观和宏观层面优于现有工作；实验探索了缩略图对点击率的影响、曝光效应和评论对用户参与的影响；基于离线 A/B 测试结果优化推荐系统参数，提高了真实世界用户参与。

Conclusion: 通过 SimUSER 框架的评估和优化，推荐系统的性能得到提升，在实际应用中提高了用户参与度。

Abstract: Recommender systems play a central role in numerous real-life applications,
yet evaluating their performance remains a significant challenge due to the gap
between offline metrics and online behaviors. Given the scarcity and limits
(e.g., privacy issues) of real user data, we introduce SimUSER, an agent
framework that serves as believable and cost-effective human proxies. SimUSER
first identifies self-consistent personas from historical data, enriching user
profiles with unique backgrounds and personalities. Then, central to this
evaluation are users equipped with persona, memory, perception, and brain
modules, engaging in interactions with the recommender system. SimUSER exhibits
closer alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at micro and macro
levels. Additionally, we conduct insightful experiments to explore the effects
of thumbnails on click rates, the exposure effect, and the impact of reviews on
user engagement. Finally, we refine recommender system parameters based on
offline A/B test results, resulting in improved user engagement in the real
world.

*Yuxuan Zong,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在ColBERT模型中修剪标记的方法，通过正则化损失和策略实现高修剪率，同时保持检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少晚期交互神经IR模型如ColBERT的内存占用，因为现有修剪方法无法保证不影响检索分数。

Method: 引入三种正则化损失和两种修剪策略，以原则性方式定义标记修剪，确保不影响文档和查询的分数。

Result: 实验显示，使用仅30%的标记即可保留ColBERT的性能，在域内和域外均有效。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效内存使用，同时维持信息检索的有效性。

Abstract: Late interaction neural IR models like ColBERT offer a competitive
effectiveness-efficiency trade-off across many benchmarks. However, they
require a huge memory space to store the contextual representation for all the
document tokens. Some works have proposed using either heuristics or
statistical-based techniques to prune tokens from each document. This however
doesn't guarantee that the removed tokens have no impact on the retrieval
score. Our work uses a principled approach to define how to prune tokens
without impacting the score between a document and a query. We introduce three
regularization losses, that induce a solution with high pruning ratios, as well
as two pruning strategies. We study them experimentally (in and out-domain),
showing that we can preserve ColBERT's performance while using only 30\% of the
tokens.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FreshStack 是一个可重用框架，用于从社区问题和答案自动构建信息检索（IR）评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了创建现实、可扩展且未受污染的 IR 和 RAG 评估基准，特别是针对快速增长的主题，以确保任务具有挑战性。

Method: FreshStack 通过以下步骤实现：(1) 自动从代码和技术文档收集语料，(2) 从社区问题和答案生成关键点，(3) 使用检索技术和混合架构进行文档检索。

Result: 构建了五个数据集，现有的检索模型显著低于理想性能，rerankers 在两个主题上未明显改善检索准确性。

Conclusion: 希望促进未来在构建真实 IR 和 RAG 评估基准的工作，并提供数据集以供使用。

Abstract: We introduce FreshStack, a reusable framework for automatically building
information retrieval (IR) evaluation benchmarks from community-asked questions
and answers. FreshStack conducts the following steps: (1) automatic corpus
collection from code and technical documentation, (2) nugget generation from
community-asked questions and answers, and (3) nugget-level support, retrieving
documents using a fusion of retrieval techniques and hybrid architectures. We
use FreshStack to build five datasets on fast-growing, recent, and niche topics
to ensure the tasks are sufficiently challenging. On FreshStack, existing
retrieval models, when applied out-of-the-box, significantly underperform
oracle approaches on all five topics, denoting plenty of headroom to improve IR
quality. In addition, we identify cases where rerankers do not clearly improve
first-stage retrieval accuracy (two out of five topics). We hope that
FreshStack will facilitate future work toward constructing realistic, scalable,
and uncontaminated IR and RAG evaluation benchmarks. FreshStack datasets are
available at: https://fresh-stack.github.io.

TL;DR: 这篇论文形式化了匿名公开公告逻辑，探讨无意图和有意图假设下的信息传播，并证明了关键逻辑属性的完备性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是处理匿名公告可能因背景知识泄露身份的情况，如社交媒体或俄罗斯卡片谜题，强调意图对信息的影响。

Method: 方法包括形式化匿名公告算子，分析两种场景（无意图可归约到认识论逻辑；有意图涉及安全公告），并使用逻辑推理。

Result: 结果显示，无意图时逻辑简化；有意图时与安全公告相关，并获得表达性和公理完备性证明。

Conclusion: 结论是，该框架提升了对匿名公告的理解，并为逻辑系统提供了完备性保证。

Abstract: We formalise the notion of an \emph{anonymous public announcement} in the
tradition of public announcement logic. Such announcements can be seen as
in-between a public announcement from ``the outside" (an announcement of
$\phi$) and a public announcement by one of the agents (an announcement of
$K_a\phi$): we get more information than just $\phi$, but not (necessarily)
about exactly who made it. Even if such an announcement is prima facie
anonymous, depending on the background knowledge of the agents it might reveal
the identity of the announcer: if I post something on a message board, the
information might reveal who I am even if I don't sign my name. Furthermore,
like in the Russian Cards puzzle, if we assume that the announcer's intention
was to stay anonymous, that in fact might reveal more information. In this
paper we first look at the case when no assumption about intentions are made,
in which case the logic with an anonymous public announcement operator is
reducible to epistemic logic. We then look at the case when we assume common
knowledge of the intention to stay anonymous, which is both more complex and
more interesting: in several ways it boils down to the notion of a ``safe"
announcement (again, similarly to Russian Cards). Main results include formal
expressivity results and axiomatic completeness for key logical languages.

Motivation: 动机是解决LLM在处理运行时信息时的不足，并探讨代码模型中纳入运行时上下文的未被充分研究领域。

Method: 方法是通过构建一个包含Jupyter笔记本开发轨迹的基准测试来测量LLM的性能。

Result: 结果是当前一代LLM在预测代码输出和代码生成任务上表现较差。

Abstract: In this work, we present a benchmark that consists of Jupyter notebooks
development trajectories and allows measuring how large language models (LLMs)
can leverage runtime information for predicting code output and code
generation. We demonstrate that the current generation of LLMs performs poorly
on these tasks and argue that there exists a significantly understudied domain
in the development of code-based models, which involves incorporating the
runtime context.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实证研究分析了代码生成LLM中的代码重复问题，并提出DeRep方法来检测和减轻重复，提高代码质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在代码生成中存在代码重复问题，导致效率低下和可读性差，需要通过研究和方法来解决。

Method: 进行定量和定性分析，研究19个LLM的重复模式，总结20种重复类型，并提出基于规则的DeRep技术。

Result: DeRep在基准测试和工业环境中显著减少重复（rep-3等指标改善91.3%以上），并提高代码通过率（Pass@1增加208.3%）。

Conclusion: DeRep有效减轻代码重复，提升代码质量，并可与其他方法结合以进一步改善性能。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation,
the quality of LLM-generated code still faces significant challenges. One
significant issue is code repetition, which refers to the model's tendency to
generate structurally redundant code, resulting in inefficiencies and reduced
readability. To address this, we conduct the first empirical study to
investigate the prevalence and nature of repetition across 19 state-of-the-art
code LLMs using three widely-used benchmarks. Our study includes both
quantitative and qualitative analyses, revealing that repetition is pervasive
and manifests at various granularities and extents, including character,
statement, and block levels. We further summarize a taxonomy of 20 repetition
patterns. Building on our findings, we propose DeRep, a rule-based technique
designed to detect and mitigate repetition in generated code. We evaluate DeRep
using both open-source benchmarks and in an industrial setting. Our results
demonstrate that DeRep significantly outperforms baselines in reducing
repetition (with an average improvements of 91.3%, 93.5%, and 79.9% in rep-3,
rep-line, and sim-line metrics) and enhancing code quality (with a Pass@1
increase of 208.3% over greedy search). Furthermore, integrating DeRep improves
the performance of existing repetition mitigation methods, with Pass@1
improvements ranging from 53.7% to 215.7%.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于海德格尔本体论的IT系统，用于更深入的查询分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是克服现有系统范畴分析的局限，通过存在分析揭示查询中的深层本体模式。

Method: 方法包括使用两个语言（范畴语言和存在语言）及现象学归约模块，进行查询处理和结构识别。

Result: 结果显示系统能识别递归结构，提供行动洞见，并在实际案例中优于现有工具。

Conclusion: 结论是这种方法为通用查询分析工具铺平道路，但需正式化存在语言并考虑局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel research analytical IT system grounded in Martin
Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology, distinguishing between beings (das Seiende)
and Being (das Sein). The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively
complete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs
and an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are
bridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze
user queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT
specialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide
actionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited
to categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological
existential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query
processing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as
metaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves
formalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's
Fundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of
beings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way
for a universal query analysis tool. The paper presents the system's
architecture, operational principles, technical implementation, use
cases--including a case based on real IT specialist dialogues--comparative
evaluation with existing tools, and its advantages and limitations.

TL;DR: 本文提出深度神经网络学习分两个阶段：快速拟合后缓慢压缩，支持证据包括grokking、double descent和信息瓶颈，强调压缩阶段对泛化重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释深度学习中延迟泛化现象，通过提出两阶段学习模型。

Method: 实证分析互信息、时间结构对齐，并类比重正化群。

Result: 展示时间尺度对齐，互信息作为进展度量，压缩阶段可能被不必要延长。

Conclusion: 压缩阶段是原则性遗忘形式，对泛化至关重要，借鉴重正化群原理。

Abstract: We propose that learning in deep neural networks proceeds in two phases: a
rapid curve fitting phase followed by a slower compression or coarse graining
phase. This view is supported by the shared temporal structure of three
phenomena: grokking, double descent and the information bottleneck, all of
which exhibit a delayed onset of generalization well after training error
reaches zero. We empirically show that the associated timescales align in two
rather different settings. Mutual information between hidden layers and input
data emerges as a natural progress measure, complementing circuit-based metrics
such as local complexity and the linear mapping number. We argue that the
second phase is not actively optimized by standard training algorithms and may
be unnecessarily prolonged. Drawing on an analogy with the renormalization
group, we suggest that this compression phase reflects a principled form of
forgetting, critical for generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像水印问题，应对生成图像增多及现有方法速度慢或鲁棒性差的挑战。

Method: 利用预训练潜在扩散模型编码图像到潜在空间，在傅里叶域植入学习水印，并用可逆流层增强表达性。

Result: 在鲁棒性和防御组合攻击上达到最先进水平，在MS-COCO、DiffusionDB和WikiArt数据集上验证。

Conclusion: WaterFlow是一种高效、鲁棒的图像水印新方法，改进了现有技术的不足。

Abstract: The ability to embed watermarks in images is a fundamental problem of
interest for computer vision, and is exacerbated by the rapid rise of generated
imagery in recent times. Current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from
computational and statistical challenges such as the slow execution speed for
practical deployments. In addition, other works trade off fast watermarking
speeds but suffer greatly in their robustness or perceptual quality. In this
work, we propose WaterFlow (WF), a fast and extremely robust approach for high
fidelity visual watermarking based on a learned latent-dependent watermark. Our
approach utilizes a pretrained latent diffusion model to encode an arbitrary
image into a latent space and produces a learned watermark that is then planted
into the Fourier Domain of the latent. The transformation is specified via
invertible flow layers that enhance the expressivity of the latent space of the
pre-trained model to better preserve image quality while permitting robust and
tractable detection. Most notably, WaterFlow demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance on general robustness and is the first method capable of
effectively defending against difficult combination attacks. We validate our
findings on three widely used real and generated datasets: MS-COCO,
DiffusionDB, and WikiArt.

Motivation: 解决WSI标注的劳动密集性、高计算需求以及预测不确定性缺失导致的信任问题。

Method: 采用自编码器提取低分辨率特征，基于不确定性选择补丁，并在高分辨率下进行无监督核分割，不使用机器学习算法。

Result: AE在UPENN-GBM数据集上的MSE为0.0016；核分割在MoNuSeg数据集上F1分数77.46%、Jaccard分数63.35%，优于其他无监督方法。

Conclusion: 证明TUMLS提高了数字病理学的效率和透明度，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Digital pathology, augmented by artificial intelligence (AI), holds
significant promise for improving the workflow of pathologists. However,
challenges such as the labor-intensive annotation of whole slide images (WSIs),
high computational demands, and trust concerns arising from the absence of
uncertainty estimation in predictions hinder the practical application of
current AI methodologies in histopathology. To address these issues, we present
a novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology
(TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to
identify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data. It
selects representative patches from each identified group based on an
uncertainty measure and then does unsupervised nuclei segmentation in their
respective higher-resolution space without using any ML algorithms. Crucially,
this solution integrates seamlessly into clinicians workflows, transforming the
examination of a whole WSI into a review of concise, interpretable cross-level
insights. This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow
while ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM
dataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016.
Additionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset,
outperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a
Jaccard score of 63.35%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TUMLS in
advancing the field of digital pathology.

Motivation: CMR 无法捕获患者的人口统计学、代谢和生活方式等因素，而现有方法数据有限且任务特定，因此需要一个整合框架来全面理解心脏健康。

Method: ViTa 利用来自 42,000 名 UK Biobank 参与者的 3D+T 动态心影图像（包括短轴和长轴视图），并与表格形式的患者数据融合，在统一框架下支持多种下游任务，如预测、分割和分类。

Result: 实现了心脏表型、生理特征的预测，以及心脏和代谢疾病的分割和分类，通过共享潜在表示提升了分析精度。

Conclusion: ViTa 向通用、患者特定的心脏健康理解迈进，提升了临床实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive
cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy
and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic,
and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and
disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand
cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an
individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly
exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have
begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data
and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a
comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a
comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of
individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants,
ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling
a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with
detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This
multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including
cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and
classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified
framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging
features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific
models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health,
highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in
cardiac analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents a review for the NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Short-form UGC
Video Quality Assessment and Enhancement. The challenge comprises two tracks:
(i) Efficient Video Quality Assessment (KVQ), and (ii) Diffusion-based Image
Super-Resolution (KwaiSR). Track 1 aims to advance the development of
lightweight and efficient video quality assessment (VQA) models, with an
emphasis on eliminating reliance on model ensembles, redundant weights, and
other computationally expensive components in the previous IQA/VQA
competitions. Track 2 introduces a new short-form UGC dataset tailored for
single image super-resolution, i.e., the KwaiSR dataset. It consists of 1,800
synthetically generated S-UGC image pairs and 1,900 real-world S-UGC images,
which are split into training, validation, and test sets using a ratio of
8:1:1. The primary objective of the challenge is to drive research that
benefits the user experience of short-form UGC platforms such as Kwai and
TikTok. This challenge attracted 266 participants and received 18 valid final
submissions with corresponding fact sheets, significantly contributing to the
progress of short-form UGC VQA and image superresolution. The project is

Result: 生成大量新拓扑材料，示例Ge₂Bi₂O₆带隙0.26 eV。

Conclusion: ReFT有效提升生成性能，同时保持材料稳定性。

Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) and topological crystalline insulators (TCIs)
are materials with unconventional electronic properties, making their discovery
highly valuable for practical applications. However, such materials,
particularly those with a full band gap, remain scarce. Given the limitations
of traditional approaches that scan known materials for candidates, we focus on
the generation of new topological materials through a generative model.
Specifically, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT) to a pre-trained
generative model, thereby aligning the model's objectives with our material
design goals. We demonstrate that ReFT is effective in enhancing the model's
ability to generate TIs and TCIs, with minimal compromise on the stability of
the generated materials. Using the fine-tuned model, we successfully identify a
large number of new topological materials, with Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$ serving as a
representative example--a TI with a full band gap of 0.26 eV, ranking among the
largest known in this category.

this paper, we first analyze the sources of hallucination in LLMs for molecular
comprehension tasks, specifically the knowledge shortcut phenomenon observed in
the PubChem dataset. To evaluate hallucination in molecular comprehension tasks
with computational efficiency, we introduce \textbf{Mol-Hallu}, a novel
free-form evaluation metric that quantifies the degree of hallucination based
on the scientific entailment relationship between generated text and actual
molecular properties. Utilizing the Mol-Hallu metric, we reassess and analyze
the extent of hallucination in various LLMs performing molecular comprehension
tasks. Furthermore, the Hallucination Reduction Post-processing stage~(HRPP) is
proposed to alleviate molecular hallucinations, Experiments show the
effectiveness of HRPP on decoder-only and encoder-decoder molecular LLMs. Our
findings provide critical insights into mitigating hallucination and improving
the reliability of LLMs in scientific applications.

Abstract: With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous
outstanding accomplishments have emerged within the open-source community. Due
to the complexity of creating and training multimodal data pairs, it is still a
computational and time-consuming process to build powerful MLLMs. In this work,
we introduce Capybara-OMNI, an MLLM that trains in a lightweight and efficient
manner and supports understanding text, image, video, and audio modalities. We
present in detail the framework design, the data construction, and the training
recipe, to develop an MLLM step-by-step to obtain competitive performance. We
also provide exclusive benchmarks utilized in our experiments to show how to
properly verify understanding capabilities across different modalities. Results
show that by following our guidance, we can efficiently build an MLLM that
achieves competitive performance among models of the same scale on various
multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, to enhance the multimodal instruction
following and conversational capabilities of the model, we further discuss how
to train the chat version upon an MLLM understanding model, which is more in
line with user habits for tasks like real-time interaction with humans. We
publicly disclose the Capybara-OMNI model, along with its chat-based version.
The disclosure includes both the model weights, a portion of the training data,
and the inference codes, which are made available on GitHub.

present our data-centric framework to build VLMs throughout the development
lifecycle. Starting from a standard model architecture, we discuss and provide
insights into two crucial development steps: data curation and iteration,
forming a closed-loop system that continuously improves model performance. We
show a detailed codebook on how to process existing massive datasets and build
user-specific data flywheel. As a demonstration, we release a VLM, named
Capybara-VL, which excels in typical multimodal tasks (e.g. , visual question
answering, scientific reasoning, and text-rich tasks). Despite its relatively
compact size, Capybara-VL surpasses several open-source models that are up to
10 times larger in size. Moreover, it achieves results that are on par with
those of several leading proprietary models, demonstrating its remarkable
competitiveness. These results highlight the power of our data-centric
framework and the potential of training smaller and more efficient VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM是否随时间变得更具创意，以及其创意输出的稳定性。

Method: 使用Divergent Association Task (DAT)和Alternative Uses Task (AUT)评估14个LLM，包括GPT-4等。

Result: 无创意提升证据；AUT中模型平均好于人类，但只有0.28%的响应达到人类高创意基准；存在显著内部变异性。

Conclusion: 强调需要更细致的评估框架，以及在创意应用中注意模型选择、提示设计和重复评估。

Abstract: Following the widespread adoption of ChatGPT in early 2023, numerous studies
reported that large language models (LLMs) can match or even surpass human
performance in creative tasks. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs have
become more creative over time, and how consistent their creative output is. In
this study, we evaluated 14 widely used LLMs -- including GPT-4, Claude, Llama,
Grok, Mistral, and DeepSeek -- across two validated creativity assessments: the
Divergent Association Task (DAT) and the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Contrary
to expectations, we found no evidence of increased creative performance over
the past 18-24 months, with GPT-4 performing worse than in previous studies.
For the more widely used AUT, all models performed on average better than the
average human, with GPT-4o and o3-mini performing best. However, only 0.28% of
LLM-generated responses reached the top 10% of human creativity benchmarks.
Beyond inter-model differences, we document substantial intra-model
variability: the same LLM, given the same prompt, can produce outputs ranging
from below-average to original. This variability has important implications for
both creativity research and practical applications. Ignoring such variability
risks misjudging the creative potential of LLMs, either inflating or
underestimating their capabilities. The choice of prompts affected LLMs
differently. Our findings underscore the need for more nuanced evaluation
frameworks and highlight the importance of model selection, prompt design, and
repeated assessment when using Generative AI (GenAI) tools in creative
contexts.

Result: 在基准测试中，性能与现有方法相当或更好，并在新型越狱数据集上表现出色。

Conclusion: 注意力机制是理解恶意输入的关键，AttentionDefense高效且适用于实际场景。

Abstract: In the past few years, Language Models (LMs) have shown par-human
capabilities in several domains. Despite their practical applications and
exceeding user consumption, they are susceptible to jailbreaks when malicious
input exploits the LM's weaknesses, causing it to deviate from its intended
behavior. Current defensive strategies either classify the input prompt as
adversarial or prevent LMs from generating harmful outputs. However, it is
challenging to explain the reason behind the malicious nature of the jailbreak,
which results in a wide variety of closed-box approaches. In this research, we
propose and demonstrate that system-prompt attention from Small Language Models
(SLMs) can be used to characterize adversarial prompts, providing a novel,
explainable, and cheaper defense approach called AttentionDefense. Our research
suggests that the attention mechanism is an integral component in understanding
and explaining how LMs respond to malicious input that is not captured in the
semantic meaning of text embeddings. The proposed AttentionDefense is evaluated
against existing jailbreak benchmark datasets. Ablation studies show that
SLM-based AttentionDefense has equivalent or better jailbreak detection
performance compared to text embedding-based classifiers and GPT-4 zero-shot
detectors.To further validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we
generate a dataset of novel jailbreak variants of the existing benchmark
dataset using a closed-loop LLM-based multi-agent system. We demonstrate that
the proposed AttentionDefense approach performs robustly on this novel
jailbreak dataset while existing approaches suffer in performance.
Additionally, for practical purposes AttentionDefense is an ideal solution as
it has the computation requirements of a small LM but the performance of a LLM
detector.

Conclusion: 倡导使用小型LLM协调协作代替单体大型模型，数据集、模型和代码已公开。

Abstract: While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance
small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models
(LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency,
and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast,
smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual
capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable
data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose
a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized
roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically
achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small
LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a
peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial
data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the
Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the
synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can
achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through
experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data
matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g.,
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large
models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic
coordination of smaller agents. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly
available at https://github.com/GX-XinGao/GRA.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效缓解RAG引入的不公平性，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant document from external knowledge sources. By referencing
this external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the generation of factually
incorrect content and addresses hallucination issues within LLMs. Recently,
there has been growing attention to improving the performance and efficiency of
RAG systems from various perspectives. While these advancements have yielded
significant results, the application of RAG in domains with considerable
societal implications raises a critical question about fairness: What impact
does the introduction of the RAG paradigm have on the fairness of LLMs? To
address this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs,
retrievers, and retrieval sources. Our experimental analysis reveals that the
scale of the LLMs plays a significant role in influencing fairness outcomes
within the RAG framework. When the model scale is smaller than 8B, the
integration of retrieval mechanisms often exacerbates unfairness in small-scale
LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA3-8B). To mitigate the fairness
issues introduced by RAG for small-scale LLMs, we propose two approaches,
FairFT and FairFilter. Specifically, in FairFT, we align the retriever with the
LLM in terms of fairness, enabling it to retrieve documents that facilitate
fairer model outputs. In FairFilter, we propose a fairness filtering mechanism
to filter out biased content after retrieval. Finally, we validate our proposed
approaches on real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in
improving fairness while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: 这项工作启发NLI研究，聚焦跨文档跨语言理解、语义检索和可解释性，并公开数据集和代码。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamental task in both natural
language processing and information retrieval. While NLI has developed many
sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual
NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for CDCL-NLI that extends traditional
NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this
task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 1,110 instances
and spanning 26 languages. To build a baseline for this task, we also propose
an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion and
interpretability prediction. Our method employs RST (Rhetorical Structure
Theory) on RGAT (Relation-aware Graph Attention Network) for cross-document
context modeling, coupled with a structure-aware semantic alignment mechanism
based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI
interpretability, we develop an EDU-level attribution framework that generates
extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's
superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both traditional
NLI models such as DocNLI and R2F, as well as LLMs like Llama3 and GPT-4o. Our
work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on
cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, semantic retrieval and
interpretability inference. Our dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and
accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e.,
timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become
available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms
on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to
phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports
using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access
textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the
Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA
and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to
physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings
(event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and
strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize
clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal
reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via
multimodal integration.

Motivation: 现有后训练方法成本高、效率低、输出过长，且基于观察：推理标记如'wait'出现于结构分隔符后，以及大型模型更强控制力。

Method: 基于两个观察，将反思步骤委托给更强模型，实现推理水平的指导，而非传统的标记级推测解码。

Result: 1.5B模型MATH500准确率从83.2%提高到89.4%，输出长度减少15.7%；Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct准确率从74.0%提高到81.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升推理模型的准确性和输出效率，证明了无训练指导方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances leverage post-training to enhance model reasoning
performance, which typically requires costly training pipelines and still
suffers from inefficient, overly lengthy outputs. We introduce Speculative
Thinking, a training-free framework that enables large reasoning models to
guide smaller ones during inference at the reasoning level, distinct from
speculative decoding, which operates at the token level. Our approach is based
on two observations: (1) reasoning-supportive tokens such as "wait" frequently
appear after structural delimiters like "\n\n", serving as signals for
reflection or continuation; and (2) larger models exhibit stronger control over
reflective behavior, reducing unnecessary backtracking while improving
reasoning quality. By strategically delegating reflective steps to a more
capable model, our method significantly boosts the reasoning accuracy of
reasoning models while shortening their output. With the assistance of the 32B
reasoning model, the 1.5B model's accuracy on MATH500 increases from 83.2% to
89.4%, marking a substantial improvement of 6.2%. Simultaneously, the average
output length is reduced from 5439 tokens to 4583 tokens, representing a 15.7%
decrease. Moreover, when applied to a non-reasoning model
(Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct), our framework boosts its accuracy from 74.0% to 81.8%
on the same benchmark, achieving a relative improvement of 7.8%.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models
(LLMs) with external knowledge, conventional single-agent RAG remains
fundamentally limited in resolving complex queries demanding coordinated
reasoning across heterogeneous data ecosystems. We present HM-RAG, a novel
Hierarchical Multi-agent Multimodal RAG framework that pioneers collaborative
intelligence for dynamic knowledge synthesis across structured, unstructured,
and graph-based data. The framework is composed of three-tiered architecture
with specialized agents: a Decomposition Agent that dissects complex queries
into contextually coherent sub-tasks via semantic-aware query rewriting and
schema-guided context augmentation; Multi-source Retrieval Agents that carry
out parallel, modality-specific retrieval using plug-and-play modules designed
for vector, graph, and web-based databases; and a Decision Agent that uses
consistency voting to integrate multi-source answers and resolve discrepancies
in retrieval results through Expert Model Refinement. This architecture attains
comprehensive query understanding by combining textual, graph-relational, and
web-derived evidence, resulting in a remarkable 12.95% improvement in answer
accuracy and a 3.56% boost in question classification accuracy over baseline
RAG systems on the ScienceQA and CrisisMMD benchmarks. Notably, HM-RAG
establishes state-of-the-art results in zero-shot settings on both datasets.
Its modular architecture ensures seamless integration of new data modalities
while maintaining strict data governance, marking a significant advancement in
addressing the critical challenges of multimodal reasoning and knowledge
synthesis in RAG systems. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法有效、鲁棒，为情感原因分析研究提供了新方向，代码已开源。

Abstract: Span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction represents a novel and
complex challenge within emotion cause analysis. This task involves identifying
emotion spans, cause spans, and their associated emotion categories within the
text to form structured triplets. While prior research has predominantly
concentrated on clause-level emotion-cause pair extraction and span-level
emotion-cause detection, these methods often confront challenges originating
from redundant information retrieval and difficulty in accurately determining
emotion categories, particularly when emotions are expressed implicitly or
ambiguously. To overcome these challenges, this study explores a fine-grained
approach to span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction and introduces
an innovative framework that leverages instruction tuning and data augmentation
techniques based on large language models. The proposed method employs
task-specific triplet extraction instructions and utilizes low-rank adaptation
to fine-tune large language models, eliminating the necessity for intricate
task-specific architectures. Furthermore, a prompt-based data augmentation
strategy is developed to address data scarcity by guiding large language models
in generating high-quality synthetic training data. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing baseline methods, achieving at least a 12.8% improvement in span-level
emotion-cause-category triplet extraction metrics. The results demonstrate the
method's effectiveness and robustness, offering a promising avenue for
advancing research in emotion cause analysis. The source code is available at

Abstract: The evaluation of open-ended responses in serious games presents a unique
challenge, as correctness is often subjective. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly being explored as evaluators in such contexts, yet their accuracy
and consistency remain uncertain, particularly for smaller models intended for
local execution. This study investigates the reliability of five small-scale
LLMs when assessing player responses in \textit{En-join}, a game that simulates
decision-making within energy communities. By leveraging traditional binary
classification metrics (including accuracy, true positive rate, and true
negative rate), we systematically compare these models across different
evaluation scenarios. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of
each model, revealing trade-offs between sensitivity, specificity, and overall
performance. We demonstrate that while some models excel at identifying correct
responses, others struggle with false positives or inconsistent evaluations.
The findings highlight the need for context-aware evaluation frameworks and
careful model selection when deploying LLMs as evaluators. This work
contributes to the broader discourse on the trustworthiness of AI-driven
assessment tools, offering insights into how different LLM architectures handle
subjective evaluation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM通过API提供服务，开发者难以检测行为变化，因此需要一种简单监测方法。

Method: 使用统计测试比较生成文本的语言和心理语言学特征分布，以判断两个样本是否等价。

Result: 在OpenAI和Meta模型上验证有效，能区分语言模型并检测提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 这种方法支持频繁LLM变化监测，且不需计算密集的基准评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often provided as a service via an API,
making it challenging for developers to detect changes in their behavior. We
present an approach to monitor LLMs for changes by comparing the distributions
of linguistic and psycholinguistic features of generated text. Our method uses
a statistical test to determine whether the distributions of features from two
samples of text are equivalent, allowing developers to identify when an LLM has
changed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five OpenAI
completion models and Meta's Llama 3 70B chat model. Our results show that
simple text features coupled with a statistical test can distinguish between
language models. We also explore the use of our approach to detect prompt
injection attacks. Our work enables frequent LLM change monitoring and avoids
computationally expensive benchmark evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化电子健康记录缺少用于过程追踪、预测和因果推理的关键数据，临床报告缺乏结构化时间定位。

Method: 比较手动（n=320）和LLM（n=390）注释PubMed开放获取病例报告，并评估LLM间一致性（n=3,103；N=93）。

Result: LLM模型事件召回率为0.80，时间一致性为0.95。

Conclusion: 建立任务、注释和评估系统，作为利用PubMed开放获取语料库进行时间分析的基准。

Abstract: Timing of clinical events is central to characterization of patient
trajectories, enabling analyses such as process tracing, forecasting, and
causal reasoning. However, structured electronic health records capture few
data elements critical to these tasks, while clinical reports lack temporal
localization of events in structured form. We present a system that transforms
case reports into textual time series-structured pairs of textual events and
timestamps. We contrast manual and large language model (LLM) annotations
(n=320 and n=390 respectively) of ten randomly-sampled PubMed open-access
(PMOA) case reports (N=152,974) and assess inter-LLM agreement (n=3,103; N=93).
We find that the LLM models have moderate event recall(O1-preview: 0.80) but
high temporal concordance among identified events (O1-preview: 0.95). By
establishing the task, annotation, and assessment systems, and by demonstrating
high concordance, this work may serve as a benchmark for leveraging the PMOA
corpus for temporal analytics.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Graph Spectral Clustering with

traditional Term Vector Space (like doc2vec, GloVe, etc.). Solutions for
combinatorial Laplacians and normalized Laplacians are discussed. An
experimental investigation shows the advantages and disadvantages of 6
different solutions proposed in the literature and in this research. The
research demonstrates that GloVe embeddings frequently cause failures of
normalized Laplacian based GSC due to negative similarities. Furthermore,
application of methods curing similarity negativity leads to accuracy
improvement for both combinatorial and normalized Laplacian based GSC. It also

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文旨在为LLM训练数据的劳动力赋予货币价值，并论证这是生产LLM的最昂贵部分。

Method: 通过研究2016年至2024年发布的64个LLM，估计从零开始支付人员生产训练数据集的成本。

Result: 即使在保守的工资估计下，训练数据集的成本是模型训练成本的10-1000倍，构成重大财务责任。

Conclusion: 强调训练数据价值与补偿缺失之间的巨大差距，并讨论未来实现更公平实践的研究方向。

Abstract: Training a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) is an increasingly
expensive endeavor due to growing computational, hardware, energy, and
engineering demands. Yet, an often-overlooked (and seldom paid) expense is the
human labor behind these models' training data. Every LLM is built on an
unfathomable amount of human effort: trillions of carefully written words
sourced from books, academic papers, codebases, social media, and more. This
position paper aims to assign a monetary value to this labor and argues that
the most expensive part of producing an LLM should be the compensation provided
to training data producers for their work. To support this position, we study
64 LLMs released between 2016 and 2024, estimating what it would cost to pay
people to produce their training datasets from scratch. Even under highly
conservative estimates of wage rates, the costs of these models' training
datasets are 10-1000 times larger than the costs to train the models
themselves, representing a significant financial liability for LLM providers.
In the face of the massive gap between the value of training data and the lack
of compensation for its creation, we highlight and discuss research directions
that could enable fairer practices in the future.

Motivation: 动机是深入理解预训练数据对语言模型表示的影响，特别是线性表示的形成机制。

Method: 方法包括研究预训练术语频率与线性表示的关联，使用OLMo-7B和GPT-J模型，测量共现频率和上下文学习准确性，并训练回归模型。

Result: 结果显示线性表示的形成与主题-对象共现频率高度相关，建立了频率阈值，并能预测不同模型的术语频率。

Conclusion: 结论是线性表示强度提供了预训练语料库的信息，可用于控制和改进模型行为。

Abstract: Pretraining data has a direct impact on the behaviors and quality of language
models (LMs), but we only understand the most basic principles of this
relationship. While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on
downstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM
representations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some
concepts are encoded `linearly' in the representations, but what factors cause
these representations to form? We study the connection between pretraining data
frequency and models' linear representations of factual relations. We find
evidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to
pretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact
triplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning
accuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations.
This is the case across all phases of pretraining. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J, we
discover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms
when the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k
times, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during
pretraining. Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear
representation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term
was seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a
different model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method
for estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data
models. We conclude that the strength of linear representations in LMs contains
signal about the models' pretraining corpora that may provide new avenues for
controlling and improving model behavior: particularly, manipulating the
models' training data to meet specific frequency thresholds.

TL;DR: 本文提出BiGTex架构，整合图神经网络和大型语言模型，用于处理文本属性图，实现了节点分类的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本属性图在表示学习中面临挑战，图神经网络无法处理文本，而大型语言模型忽略图结构，因此需要双向整合。

Method: 提出BiGTex，使用堆叠的图-文本融合单元实现互相关注，并通过参数高效微调（LoRA）训练。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，BiGTex在节点分类中达到最先进性能，并有效泛化到链接预测，消融研究证实了关键组件的重要性。

Conclusion: BiGTex证明了GNN和LLM的双向融合能显著提升文本属性图的学习效果。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation
learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of
node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph
neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the
capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs)
are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph
structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel
architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text
Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and
structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions,
text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The
proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA),
keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves
state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively
to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft
prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.

TL;DR: 偏好调整模型增加了有效语义多样性，尽管减少了句法多样性；较小模型在生成独特内容方面更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的研究显示偏好调整技术减少了输出多样性，这在需要多样输出的应用中造成困境，因此本论文引入了一个测量有效语义多样性的框架。

Method: 引入一个框架来测量有效语义多样性，使用不需要人工干预的开放式任务，比较偏好调整模型（如RLHF方法）与SFT或基础模型。

Result: 偏好调整模型减少了词汇和句法多样性，但产生了更大的有效语义多样性，主要因为生成了更多高质量输出；较小模型在固定采样预算下更参数高效。

Conclusion: 这些发现对需要多样且高质量输出的应用（如创意辅助和合成数据生成）有重要启示。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that preference-tuning techniques--including
Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences (RLHF) methods like PPO and GRPO,
as well as alternatives like DPO--reduce diversity, creating a dilemma given
that such models are widely deployed in applications requiring diverse outputs.
To address this, we introduce a framework for measuring effective semantic
diversity--diversity among outputs that meet quality thresholds--which better
reflects the practical utility of large language models (LLMs). Using
open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive
results: although preference-tuned models--especially those trained via
RL--exhibit reduced lexical and syntactic diversity, they produce greater
effective semantic diversity than SFT or base models, not from increasing
diversity among high-quality outputs, but from generating more high-quality
outputs overall. We discover that preference tuning reduces syntactic diversity
while preserving semantic diversity--revealing a distinction between diversity
in form and diversity in content that traditional metrics often overlook. Our
analysis further shows that smaller models are consistently more
parameter-efficient at generating unique content within a fixed sampling
budget, offering insights into the relationship between model scaling and
diversity. These findings have important implications for applications that
require diverse yet high-quality outputs, from creative assistance to synthetic
data generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在面对真实世界信息演变时的更新挑战，因为现有方法局限于实体替换，无法捕捉复杂动态。

Method: 引入了Knowledge Update Playground (KUP)，一个自动模拟知识更新的管道，以及memory conditioned training (MCT)，通过在训练中条件化更新语料上的自生成'记忆'标记来提升记忆和推理。

Result: 在两个强LLM上，KUP基准非常具有挑战性，最好的CPT模型在间接探测（推理）设置中成绩不到2%；MCT训练显著优于先前的CPT基准，直接探测（记忆）结果提高了多达25.4%。

Conclusion: MCT是一种有效的知识更新方法，KUP为未来的研究提供了强大的基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of pre-trained knowledge in
their parameters, but updating them as real-world information evolves remains a
challenge. Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity
substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an
automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an
evidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect
probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for
any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called
memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus
on self-generated "memory" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs
to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results
on two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the
best CPT models achieving $<2\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and
(2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT)
baselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\%$.

Result: 高提取率与书籍流行度相关，微调撤销缓解策略，主要在较低transformer块的少量权重。

Conclusion: 证明当前缓解策略有限，并提供研究框架。

Abstract: To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B
family of models, and the "prefix-prompting" extraction technique, we were able
to auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one
entire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens.
We were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books,
piece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We
show that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus,
likely duplication in the training data.
  We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama
3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this
undoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated
primarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the
limits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework
for studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in
aligned LLMs.

Abstract: Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data
generated using larger Language models. Questions remain about leveraging
synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains.
A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts
its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we
propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances
diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple
"expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million
tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a
well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and
Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in
general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data
using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM
pre-training corpora.
  Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms
the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in
Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data
generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior
generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest
that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real
data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) sometimes fail to respond appropriately to
deterministic tasks -- such as counting or forming acronyms -- because the
implicit prior distribution they have learned over sequences of tokens
influences their responses. In this work, we show that, in at least some cases,
LLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly,
and we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this
information to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting
the language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic
improvements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability
techniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to
which that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is
possible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate
with the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of
these layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high
performance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information
required to produce a correct response is contained within the representations
of the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning
is significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error
after finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest
that it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent
to which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially
increasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons
related to the prior probability of token sequences.

Abstract: There is a long history of building predictive models in healthcare using
tabular data from electronic medical records. However, these models fail to
extract the information found in unstructured clinical notes, which document
diagnosis, treatment, progress, medications, and care plans. In this study, we
investigate how answers generated by GPT-4o-mini (ChatGPT) to simple clinical
questions about patients, when given access to the patient's discharge summary,
can support patient-level mortality prediction. Using data from 14,011
first-time admissions to the Coronary Care or Cardiovascular Intensive Care
Units in the MIMIC-IV Note dataset, we implement a transparent framework that
uses GPT responses as input features in logistic regression models. Our
findings demonstrate that GPT-based models alone can outperform models trained
on standard tabular data, and that combining both sources of information yields
even greater predictive power, increasing AUC by an average of 5.1 percentage
points and increasing positive predictive value by 29.9 percent for the
highest-risk decile. These results highlight the value of integrating large
language models (LLMs) into clinical prediction tasks and underscore the
broader potential for using LLMs in any domain where unstructured text data
remains an underutilized resource.

Motivation: LLM在长上下文推理上困难，由于计算复杂度二次方增长和长上下文数据稀缺、标注成本高，缺乏开源工作和超10万tokens数据集。

Method: 引入后训练合成数据生成策略，并采用逐步RoPE缩放训练策略，无需受限于真实数据长度。

Result: 模型在1M tokens上下文长度下，在RULER和InfiniteBench基准上表现良好，并维持一般语言任务的稳健性能。

Conclusion: 这种方法有效解决长上下文数据稀缺问题，证明了扩展LLM上下文窗口的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with long-context reasoning, not only
due to the quadratic scaling of computational complexity with sequence length
but also because of the scarcity and expense of annotating long-context data.
There has been barely any open-source work that systematically ablates
long-context data, nor is there any openly available instruction tuning dataset
with contexts surpassing 100K tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
post-training synthetic data generation strategy designed to efficiently extend
the context window of LLMs while preserving their general task performance. Our
approach scalably extends to arbitrarily long context lengths, unconstrained by
the length of available real-world data, which effectively addresses the
scarcity of raw long-context data. Through a step-by-step rotary position
embedding (RoPE) scaling training strategy, we demonstrate that our model, with

TL;DR: Persona-judge 提供了一种无需训练的、有效的个性化语言模型对齐方法，使用内部判断机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型与人类偏好对齐的挑战，特别是实现个性化而不增加过多计算成本。现有的方法依赖奖励信号和标注数据，限制了可扩展性和适应性。

Method: 引入 Persona-judge，一个新型判别范式，支持无训练的个性化对齐。使用草稿模型基于给定偏好生成候选标记，判断模型基于另一个偏好交叉验证是否接受。

Result: 实验结果显示，Persona-judge 提供了一个可扩展、高效的个性化对齐解决方案。

Conclusion: 为更适应性和自定义的对齐铺平道路。

Abstract: Aligning language models with human preferences presents significant
challenges, particularly in achieving personalization without incurring
excessive computational costs. Existing methods rely on reward signals and
additional annotated data, limiting their scalability and adaptability to
diverse human values. To address these challenges, we introduce Persona-judge,
a novel discriminative paradigm that enables training-free personalized
alignment with unseen preferences. Instead of optimizing policy parameters
through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic
preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model
generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge
model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens
whether to be accepted. Experimental results demonstrate that Persona-judge,
using the inherent preference evaluation mechanisms of the model, offers a
scalable and computationally efficient solution to personalized alignment,
paving the way for more adaptive customized alignment.

*Singon Kim,Gunho Jung,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACoRN 通过增强对检索噪声的鲁棒性和关注关键信息来改进 RAG 中的抽象压缩，导致在噪声数据集上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决抽象压缩器在检索文档中遗漏重要信息的问题，特别是当文档包含无关或误导性内容时，尤其在长上下文中。

Method: 提出 ACoRN，包括两个训练步骤：离线数据增强以提高对检索噪声的鲁棒性，以及微调以生成以支持正确答案的关键信息为中心的摘要。

Result: 实验显示，使用 ACoRN 训练的 T5-large 模型提高了 EM 和 F1 分数，保留了答案字符串，并在包含许多降低准确性的文档的数据集上表现出色。

Conclusion: ACoRN 在真实世界场景中处理噪声数据时非常有用，提升了实用性。

Abstract: Abstractive compression utilizes smaller langauge models to condense
query-relevant context, reducing computational costs in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). However,retrieved documents often include information that is
either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect
content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that
abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential
for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion
occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more
fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise
(ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data
augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against
two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language modelbased
compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents
and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries
centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our
experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor,
improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve
as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy-reducing
documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAIL 是一种新的多域无监督学习框架，能够在去除敏感信息的同时更好地保留有用知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练中学习了敏感信息，引发了'被遗忘权'等社会和法律问题。现有的方法在多域场景下失效，导致过度移除知识或性能下降。

Method: 提出 GRAIL 框架，利用梯度信息区分无监督和保留范围，并采用自适应参数级本地化策略选择性地移除目标知识。

Result: 在基准测试中，GRAIL 的无监督成功率与现有方法相当，但知识保留成功率比最先进方法高出高达 17%。

Conclusion: 建立了管理大型预训练语言模型中敏感信息的新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive datasets often learn
sensitive information, which raises significant social and legal concerns under
principles such as the "Right to be forgotten." Retraining entire models from
scratch to remove undesired information is both costly and impractical.
Furthermore, existing single-domain unlearning methods fail to address
multi-domain scenarios, where knowledge is interwoven across domains such as
privacy and copyright, creating overlapping representations that lead to
excessive knowledge removal or degraded performance. To tackle these issues, we
propose GRAIL (GRadient-based AdaptIve unLearning), a novel multi-domain
unlearning framework. GRAIL leverages gradient information from multiple
domains to precisely distinguish the unlearning scope from the retention scope,
and applies an adaptive parameter-wise localization strategy to selectively
remove targeted knowledge while preserving critical parameters for each domain.
Experimental results on unlearning benchmarks show that GRAIL achieves
unlearning success on par with the existing approaches, while also
demonstrating up to 17% stronger knowledge retention success compared to the
previous state-of-art method. Our findings establish a new paradigm for
effectively managing and regulating sensitive information in large-scale
pre-trained language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 USKR 方法依赖任务特定策略或自定义表示，无法利用任务间知识转移或与 LLM 预训练对齐，限制了性能。

Method: 提出 Pandora 框架，利用 Pandas API 构建统一知识表示，LLM 生成推理步骤和 Python 代码，使用训练示例记忆促进知识转移。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，Pandora 优于现有统一框架，并与任务特定方法竞争。

Conclusion: Pandora 有效提升了 USKR 性能，展示了统一框架的潜力。

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and
knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on
employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which
struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or
align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper
proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage
of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge
representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to
generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question.
Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various
SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora}
outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with
task-specific methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in general domains and demonstrated promise in multimodal
mathematical reasoning. However, applying MLLMs to geometry problem solving
(GPS) remains challenging due to lack of accurate step-by-step solution data
and severe hallucinations during reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoGen, a
pipeline that can automatically generates step-wise reasoning paths for
geometry diagrams. By leveraging the precise symbolic reasoning,
\textbf{GeoGen} produces large-scale, high-quality question-answer pairs. To
further enhance the logical reasoning ability of MLLMs, we train
\textbf{GeoLogic}, a Large Language Model (LLM) using synthetic data generated
by GeoGen. Serving as a bridge between natural language and symbolic systems,
GeoLogic enables symbolic tools to help verifying MLLM outputs, making the
reasoning process more rigorous and alleviating hallucinations. Experimental
results show that our approach consistently improves the performance of MLLMs,
achieving remarkable results on benchmarks for geometric reasoning tasks. This
improvement stems from our integration of the strengths of LLMs and symbolic
systems, which enables a more reliable and interpretable approach for the GPS
task. Codes are available at https://github.com/ycpNotFound/GeoGen.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced AI agents
as a disruptive paradigm across various industries, yet their application in
machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper describes and
analyses the potential of single- and multi-agent systems for MT, reflecting on
how they could enhance multilingual digital communication. While single-agent
systems are well-suited for simpler translation tasks, multi-agent systems,
which involve multiple specialized AI agents collaborating in a structured
manner, may offer a promising solution for complex scenarios requiring high
accuracy, domain-specific knowledge, and contextual awareness. To demonstrate
the feasibility of multi-agent workflows in MT, we are conducting a pilot study
in legal MT. The study employs a multi-agent system involving four specialized
AI agents for (i) translation, (ii) adequacy review, (iii) fluency review, and
(iv) final editing. Our findings suggest that multi-agent systems may have the
potential to significantly improve domain-adaptability and contextual
awareness, with superior translation quality to traditional MT or single-agent
systems. This paper also sets the stage for future research into multi-agent
applications in MT, integration into professional translation workflows, and
shares a demo of the system analyzed in the paper.

Motivation: 当前LLM易捕获数据集偏差，导致泛化差；现有去偏方法因偏差多样性和上下文学习不足而效果有限。

Method: 框架先用信息增益引导因果干预自动平衡数据集，然后通过监督微调训练LLM。

Result: 实验显示IGCIDB有效去偏LLM，提升不同任务的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结合因果机制和信息理论，IGCIDB成功改善LLM泛化性能。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies indicate that current large
language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them during
inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. However, due to the
diversity of dataset biases and the insufficient nature of bias suppression
based on in-context learning, the effectiveness of previous prior
knowledge-based debiasing methods and in-context learning based automatic
debiasing methods is limited. To address these challenges, we explore the
combination of causal mechanisms with information theory and propose an
information gain-guided causal intervention debiasing (IGCIDB) framework. This
framework first utilizes an information gain-guided causal intervention method
to automatically and autonomously balance the distribution of
instruction-tuning dataset. Subsequently, it employs a standard supervised
fine-tuning process to train LLMs on the debiased dataset. Experimental results
show that IGCIDB can effectively debias LLM to improve its generalizability
across different tasks.

Method: 提出NaVAB基准及其国家价值提取管道，包括指令标记建模、筛选过程和冲突减少机制。

Result: 实验显示NaVAB可识别LLMs的misaligned场景，并通过alignment技术有效减少价值问题。

Conclusion: NaVAB是有效的工具，可帮助改善LLMs与国家价值观的alignment。

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) hold positions that conflict with your
country's values? Occasionally they do! However, existing works primarily focus
on ethical reviews, failing to capture the diversity of national values, which
encompass broader policy, legal, and moral considerations. Furthermore, current
benchmarks that rely on spectrum tests using manually designed questionnaires
are not easily scalable.
  To address these limitations, we introduce NaVAB, a comprehensive benchmark
to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with the values of five major nations: China,
the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. NaVAB implements a
national value extraction pipeline to efficiently construct value assessment
datasets. Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure with instruction
tagging to process raw data sources, a screening process to filter
value-related topics and a generation process with a Conflict Reduction
mechanism to filter non-conflicting values.We conduct extensive experiments on
various LLMs across countries, and the results provide insights into assisting
in the identification of misaligned scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate that
NaVAB can be combined with alignment techniques to effectively reduce value
concerns by aligning LLMs' values with the target country.

Result: 简单重试方法通常优于复杂框架，表明复杂性不总是必要的。

Conclusion: 挑战复杂策略必然更好的假设，建议重试可能就足够。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the
development of general-purpose autonomous agents, demonstrating remarkable
performance in complex reasoning tasks across various domains. This surge has
spurred the evolution of a plethora of prompt-based reasoning frameworks. A
recent focus has been on iterative reasoning strategies that refine outputs
through self-evaluation and verbalized feedback. However, these strategies
require additional computational complexity to enable models to recognize and
correct their mistakes, leading to a significant increase in their cost. In
this work, we introduce the concept of ``retrials without feedback'', an
embarrassingly simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing reasoning frameworks
by allowing LLMs to retry problem-solving attempts upon identifying incorrect
answers. Unlike conventional iterative refinement methods, our method does not
require explicit self-reflection or verbalized feedback, simplifying the
refinement process. Our findings indicate that simpler retrial-based approaches
often outperform more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, suggesting that the
benefits of complex methods may not always justify their computational costs.
By challenging the prevailing assumption that more intricate reasoning
strategies inherently lead to better performance, our work offers new insights
into how simpler, more efficient approaches can achieve optimal results. So,
are retrials all you need?

Motivation: LLM在内部和外部信息之间存在知识冲突，导致响应不可靠和不确定性。

Result: 实验在单选、QA和RAG任务中验证了理论发现，并提升单选任务准确率至少7.54%。

Conclusion: Swin-VIB框架有效提高了LLM在知识冲突中的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
information retrieval systems, particularly in response generation (RG).
Unfortunately, LLMs often face knowledge conflicts between internal memory and
retrievaled external information, arising from misinformation, biases, or
outdated knowledge. These conflicts undermine response reliability and
introduce uncertainty in decision-making. In this work, we analyze how LLMs
navigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic perspective and
reveal that when conflicting and supplementary information exhibit significant
differences, LLMs confidently resolve their preferences. However, when the
distinction is ambiguous, LLMs experience heightened uncertainty. Based on this
insight, we propose Swin-VIB, a novel framework that integrates a pipeline of
variational information bottleneck models into adaptive augmentation of
retrieved information and guiding LLM preference in response generation.
Extensive experiments on single-choice, open-ended question-answering (QA), and
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate the efficacy of Swin-VIB. Notably, our method improves
single-choice task accuracy by at least 7.54\% over competitive baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive information during
training, posing risks when deploying publicly accessible models. Current
machine unlearning methods struggle to selectively remove specific data
associations without degrading overall model capabilities. This paper presents
our solution to SemEval-2025 Task 4 on targeted unlearning, which introduces a
two-stage methodology that combines causal mediation analysis with
layer-specific optimization. Through systematic causal tracing experiments on
OLMo architectures (1B and 7B parameters), we identify the critical role of the
first few transformer layers (layers 0-5) in storing subject-attribute
associations within MLP modules. Building on this insight, we develop a
constrained optimization approach that freezes upper layers while applying a
novel joint loss function to lower layers-simultaneously maximizing forget set
loss via output token cross-entropy penalties and minimizing retain set
deviation through adaptive regularization. Our method achieves 2nd place in the
1B model track, demonstrating strong task performance while maintaining 88% of
baseline MMLU accuracy. These results establish causal-informed layer
optimization as a promising paradigm for efficient, precise unlearning in LLMs,
offering a significant step forward in addressing data privacy concerns in AI
systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为现有奖励模型和对齐管道提供可扩展有效的增强。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex
human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges,
we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc
refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM
models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human
preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It
achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware
contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs
without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across
different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate
significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to
a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard
RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined
rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These
results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for
existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries tailored to specific
aspects, addressing the resource constraints and limited generalizability of
traditional summarization approaches. Recently, large language models have
shown promise in this task without the need for training. However, they rely
excessively on prompt engineering and face token limits and hallucination
challenges, especially with in-context learning. To address these challenges,
in this paper, we propose a novel framework for aspect-based summarization:
Self-Aspect Retrieval Enhanced Summary Generation. Rather than relying solely
on in-context learning, given an aspect, we employ an embedding-driven
retrieval mechanism to identify its relevant text segments. This approach
extracts the pertinent content while avoiding unnecessary details, thereby
mitigating the challenge of token limits. Moreover, our framework optimizes
token usage by deleting unrelated parts of the text and ensuring that the model
generates output strictly based on the given aspect. With extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our framework not only achieves
superior performance but also effectively mitigates the token limitation
problem.

Conclusion: 提供简单可编程的方式应用SMC到各种受控生成问题，提升性能和用户可用性。

Abstract: A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to
syntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally
framed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting
distribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution
-- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for
controlled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC
framework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific
constraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational
resources in light of new information during the course of generation. By
comparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains
-- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and
molecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach
allows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger,
as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic
perspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better
approximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework
of Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic
programming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a
broad variety of controlled generation problems.

Encoder (USE), and a zero-shot classifier -- against expert-labeled data and
narrative text. The analysis is further extended to four large language models
(LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen, and Claude. Our results reveal a counterintuitive
trend: models with higher technical accuracy often exhibit lower agreement with
domain experts, whereas LLMs demonstrate greater expert alignment despite
relatively lower accuracy scores. To quantify and interpret model-expert
agreement, we employ Cohen's Kappa, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and
SHAP-based explainability techniques. Findings indicate that expert-aligned
models tend to rely more on contextual and temporal language cues, rather than
location-specific keywords. These results underscore that accuracy alone is
insufficient for evaluating models in safety-critical NLP applications. We
advocate for incorporating expert agreement as a complementary metric in model
evaluation frameworks and highlight the promise of LLMs as interpretable,
scalable tools for crash analysis pipelines.

### [154] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Conflicting Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13079)
*Han Wang,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAMDocs dataset and MADAM-RAG method to handle ambiguity, misinformation, and noise in RAG for LLMs, improving response factuality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work addressed challenges like ambiguity and misinformation separately, but this paper tackles them jointly to simulate realistic scenarios.

Method: Proposes RAMDocs dataset with conflicting evidence and MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent debate system using LLMs to disambiguate and filter misinformation.

Result: MADAM-RAG improves performance by up to 11.40% on AmbigDocs and 15.80% on FaithEval, but baselines struggle with RAMDocs (e.g., 32.60% exact match score).

Conclusion: MADAM-RAG effectively addresses multiple conflict sources, but gaps remain, especially with imbalanced evidence, indicating need for further research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly employing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the factuality of their
responses. However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous
user queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources
while also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant
documents. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in
isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or
robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors
simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and
Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and
realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including
ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent
approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple
rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to
disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby
handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which
requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over
strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires
suppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with
Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for
existing RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match
score). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our
analysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing
the level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.

Result: 呈現AA在多個科學領域的應用和挑戰，識別未來研究機會。

Conclusion: 強調AA的重要未來研究方向。

Abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) was originally proposed in 1994 by Adele Cutler and
Leo Breiman as a computational procedure to extract the distinct aspects called
archetypes in observations with each observational record approximated as a
mixture (i.e., convex combination) of these archetypes. AA thereby provides
straightforward, interpretable, and explainable representations for feature
extraction and dimensionality reduction, facilitating the understanding of the
structure of high-dimensional data with wide applications throughout the
sciences. However, AA also faces challenges, particularly as the associated
optimization problem is non-convex. This survey provides researchers and data
mining practitioners an overview of methodologies and opportunities that AA has
to offer surveying the many applications of AA across disparate fields of
science, as well as best practices for modeling data using AA and limitations.
The survey concludes by explaining important future research directions
concerning AA.

Result: 通过模拟数据和空气质量数据集展示了方法的性能。

Conclusion: funWeightClustSkew方法在处理功能数据聚类时有效，尤其适用于数据偏斜的情况。

Abstract: We propose a clustering method, funWeightClustSkew, based on mixtures of
functional linear regression models and three skewed multivariate
distributions: the variance-gamma distribution, the skew-t distribution, and
the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution. Our approach follows the framework of
the functional high dimensional data clustering (funHDDC) method, and we extend
to functional data the cluster weighted models based on skewed distributions
used for finite dimensional multivariate data. We consider several parsimonious
models, and to estimate the parameters we construct an expectation maximization
(EM) algorithm. We illustrate the performance of funWeightClustSkew for
simulated data and for the Air Quality dataset.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 简而言之，这篇论文通过反馈控制改进近端梯度方法，减少偏差并加速收敛。


<details>

Motivation: 近端梯度方法易于实现，但会产生偏差解且收敛缓慢。

Result: 为强凸问题开发并证明收敛性，数值模拟验证扩展到非强凸情况。

Conclusion: 方法可在合理迭代次数内获得无偏差解，并有效。

Abstract: Proximal gradient methods are popular in sparse optimization as they are
straightforward to implement. Nevertheless, they achieve biased solutions,
requiring many iterations to converge. This work addresses these issues through
a suitable feedback control of the algorithm's hyperparameter. Specifically, by
designing an integral control that does not substantially impact the
computational complexity, we can reach an unbiased solution in a reasonable
number of iterations. In the paper, we develop and analyze the convergence of
the proposed approach for strongly-convex problems. Moreover, numerical
simulations validate and extend the theoretical results to the non-strongly
convex framework.

TL;DR: 本论文在随机梯度下降中，通过无限记忆的泛化SGD，实现了在无限维二次问题上的最优收敛率O(t^{-2ζ})。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机GD算法在噪声影响下无法达到确定性GD的加速收敛率O(t^{-2ζ})，因此需要开发新方法提升性能。

Method: 通过将GD算法与复平面轮廓关联，并优化角θ来平衡加速和噪声，开发了具有无限记忆的SGD算法。

Result: 证明了最优θ_max = min(2, ν, 2/(ζ + 1/ν))，并使用有限内存近似在合成问题和MNIST上验证了效率。

Conclusion: 新算法在随机优化中实现了更快的收敛率，并通过实验证明了其实际有效性。

Abstract: We consider SGD-type optimization on infinite-dimensional quadratic problems
with power law spectral conditions. It is well-known that on such problems
deterministic GD has loss convergence rates $L_t=O(t^{-\zeta})$, which can be
improved to $L_t=O(t^{-2\zeta})$ by using Heavy Ball with a non-stationary
Jacobi-based schedule (and the latter rate is optimal among fixed schedules).
However, in the mini-batch Stochastic GD setting, the sampling noise causes the
Jacobi HB to diverge; accordingly no $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ algorithm is known. In
this paper we show that rates up to $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ can be achieved by a
generalized stationary SGD with infinite memory. We start by identifying
generalized (S)GD algorithms with contours in the complex plane. We then show
that contours that have a corner with external angle $\theta\pi$ accelerate the
plain GD rate $O(t^{-\zeta})$ to $O(t^{-\theta\zeta})$. For deterministic GD,
increasing $\theta$ allows to achieve rates arbitrarily close to
$O(t^{-2\zeta})$. However, in Stochastic GD, increasing $\theta$ also amplifies
the sampling noise, so in general $\theta$ needs to be optimized by balancing
the acceleration and noise effects. We prove that the optimal rate is given by
$\theta_{\max}=\min(2,\nu,\tfrac{2}{\zeta+1/\nu})$, where $\nu,\zeta$ are the
exponents appearing in the capacity and source spectral conditions.
Furthermore, using fast rational approximations of the power functions, we show
that ideal corner algorithms can be efficiently approximated by finite-memory
algorithms, and demonstrate their practical efficiency on a synthetic problem
and MNIST.

Motivation: 动机是提供随机过程收敛的定量速率，改善现有定理的精确性和统一性。

Method: 方法是通过证明通用结果并应用于Robbins-Siegmund定理、Dvoretzky收敛定理及随机拟Fejér序列。

Result: 结果包括导出了定量版本的定理、显式收敛速率及特殊情况下的线性速率。

Conclusion: 结论展示了方法的广泛应用潜力，并讨论了与其他迭代过程的适用性。

Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic
processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our
result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and
effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean
and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in the sense that it only
depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration.
We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known
concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing
effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's
convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er
monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly
general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro
procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their
applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of
potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other
well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation, covering a range
of different applied scenarios to which our methods can be immediately applied.
Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which even
allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.

Conclusion: 促进 AI 助手的安全可扩展数据访问，强调防御深度方法，支持更安全透明的 AI 创新。

Abstract: As Agentic AI gain mainstream adoption, the industry invests heavily in model
capabilities, achieving rapid leaps in reasoning and quality. However, these
systems remain largely confined to data silos, and each new integration
requires custom logic that is difficult to scale. The Model Context Protocol
(MCP) addresses this challenge by defining a universal, open standard for
securely connecting AI-based applications (MCP clients) to data sources (MCP
servers). However, the flexibility of the MCP introduces new risks, including
malicious tool servers and compromised data integrity. We present MCP Guardian,
a framework that strengthens MCP-based communication with authentication,
rate-limiting, logging, tracing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) scanning.
Through real-world scenarios and empirical testing, we demonstrate how MCP
Guardian effectively mitigates attacks and ensures robust oversight with
minimal overheads. Our approach fosters secure, scalable data access for AI
assistants, underscoring the importance of a defense-in-depth approach that
enables safer and more transparent innovation in AI-driven environments.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于Transformer的两阶段波束训练算法，用于RIS辅助的极大规模天线阵列系统，提高了波束聚焦精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极大规模天线阵列系统导致信号传播转向近场球波，设计包含角度和距离域的二维波束码本具有挑战性。

Method: 引入Transformer-based两阶段波束训练算法，包括粗略搜索和精细搜索阶段，使用简单和精确码本。

Result: 在SNR 20dB时，波束选择准确率达97%，比基线方法提高10%到50%。

Conclusion: 实验结果显示，RIS辅助波束聚焦的精度大大提升。

Abstract: The massive number of antennas in extremely large aperture array (ELAA)
systems shifts the propagation regime of signals in internet of things (IoT)
communication systems towards near-field spherical wave propagation. We propose
a reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted beamfocusing mechanism,
where the design of the two-dimensional beam codebook that contains both the
angular and distance domains is challenging. To address this issue, we
introduce a novel Transformer-based two-stage beam training algorithm, which
includes the coarse and fine search phases. The proposed mechanism provides a
fine-grained codebook with enhanced spatial resolution, enabling precise
beamfocusing. Specifically, in the first stage, the beam training is performed
to estimate the approximate location of the device by using a simple codebook,
determining whether it is within the beamfocusing range (BFR) or the
none-beamfocusing range (NBFR). In the second stage, by using a more precise
codebook, a fine-grained beam search strategy is conducted. Experimental
results unveil that the precision of the RIS-assisted beamfocusing is greatly
improved. The proposed method achieves beam selection accuracy up to 97% at
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB, and improves 10% to 50% over the baseline
method at different SNRs.

Conclusion: 建议MIMO系统作为神经网络的范式转变，适用于超低功耗无线设备。

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that an eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system with appropriate analog combining
components exhibits the properties of a universal function approximator,
similar to a feedforward neural network. By treating the XL MIMO channel
coefficients as the random nodes of a hidden layer, and the receiver's analog
combiner as a trainable output layer, we cast the end-to-end system to the
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework, leading to a novel formulation for
Over-The-Air (OTA) edge inference without requiring traditional digital
processing nor pre-processing at the transmitter. Through theoretical analysis
and numerical evaluation, we showcase that XL-MIMO-ELM enables
near-instantaneous training and efficient classification, suggesting the
paradigm shift of beyond massive MIMO systems as neural networks alongside
their profound communications role. Compared to deep learning approaches and
conventional ELMs, the proposed framework achieves on par performance with
orders of magnitude lower complexity, making it highly attractive for ultra low
power wireless devices.

Motivation: 零样本协调是人类兼容AI的关键，但现有方法无法泛化到新任务，因此需开发通用合作技能。

Method: 引入跨环境合作（CEC）范式，使用Jax-based生成器创建大量协调挑战，并在环境分布上进行强化学习。

Result: CEC在与真实人类合作时优于基线，代理发展出通用规范，提升了与不同伙伴的协作性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明，通过跨多种场景学习合作，可以设计出无需人类数据即可与人类交互的通用合作代理。

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC), the ability to adapt to a new partner in a
cooperative task, is a critical component of human-compatible AI. While prior
work has focused on training agents to cooperate on a single task, these
specialized models do not generalize to new tasks, even if they are highly
similar. Here, we study how reinforcement learning on a distribution of
environments with a single partner enables learning general cooperative skills
that support ZSC with many new partners on many new problems. We introduce two
Jax-based, procedural generators that create billions of solvable coordination
challenges. We develop a new paradigm called Cross-Environment Cooperation
(CEC), and show that it outperforms competitive baselines quantitatively and
qualitatively when collaborating with real people. Our findings suggest that
learning to collaborate across many unique scenarios encourages agents to
develop general norms, which prove effective for collaboration with different
partners. Together, our results suggest a new route toward designing generalist
cooperative agents capable of interacting with humans without requiring human
data.

The framework divides MAS into seven layers: multi-agent collaboration,

single-agent multi-capability incarnation, different single agents using the
same large model to achieve the same target agent, single-agent using different
large models to achieve the same target agent, and multi-agent synthesis of the
same target agent. Through experimental validation in art creation, the
framework demonstrates its unique advantages in task collaboration, cross-scene

Abstract: Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep
uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests.
Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable
tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating
potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be
inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization
approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and
comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting
climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address
these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate
simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis,
including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state
spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation.
Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions
interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation
for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important
limitations and areas for future research.

Result: 在标准MARL基准测试中，QLLM优于现有基线，展示强泛化能力和兼容性。

Conclusion: QLLM是复杂多代理场景中一个有前景的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this
issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with
decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to
approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the
global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in
various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including
imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor
scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic
construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs).
Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit
allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear
functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is
further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of
executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination
and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on
several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM
exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a
wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a
promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound
exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech
(TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling
the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose
EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language
models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion
control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme
tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by
chain-of-thought (CoT) and modality-of-thought (CoM) techniques. Besides, we
introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring
expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language
descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English
EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese
Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability
of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human
perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and
Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EmoVoice-DF55. Dataset, code, and checkpoints

Abstract: We propose a new theory for aging based on dynamical systems and provide a
data-driven computational method to quantify the changes at the cellular level.
We use ergodic theory to decompose the dynamics of changes during aging and
show that aging is fundamentally a dissipative process within biological
systems, akin to dynamical systems where dissipation occurs due to
non-conservative forces. To quantify the dissipation dynamics, we employ a
transformer-based machine learning algorithm to analyze gene expression data,
incorporating age as a token to assess how age-related dissipation is reflected
in the embedding space. By evaluating the dynamics of gene and age embeddings,
we provide a cellular aging map (CAM) and identify patterns indicative of
divergence in gene embedding space, nonlinear transitions, and entropy
variations during aging for various tissues and cell types. Our results provide
a novel perspective on aging as a dissipative process and introduce a
computational framework that enables measuring age-related changes with
molecular resolution.

TL;DR: 通过调整随机神经网络中的全局参数，观察到吸引子合并危机和间歇性现象，这种现象在一般随机神经网络中是固有的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索水库计算中随机神经网络吸引子行为的对称约束，发现新的分叉现象。

Method: 通过详细分析相空间结构来揭示底层机制。

Result: 发现调整全局参数会导致吸引子合并危机伴随间歇性，且这种分叉场景独立于训练数据。

Conclusion: 这种分叉场景是随机神经网络的内在特性，不依赖于特定训练数据。

Abstract: Reservoir computing can embed attractors into random neural networks (RNNs),
generating a ``mirror'' of a target attractor because of its inherent
symmetrical constraints. In these RNNs, we report that an attractor-merging
crisis accompanied by intermittency emerges simply by adjusting the global
parameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed
analysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation
scenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下声学目标识别对海洋多样性保护和国家防御安全重要，但深度学习面临样本稀缺和环境干扰挑战。

Method: 提出多任务平衡通道注意力卷积神经网络（MT-BCA-CNN），整合通道注意力机制和多任务学习，优化分类和特征重建。

Conclusion: 提供高效少样本水下声学识别解决方案，促进海洋生物声学和声呐信号处理研究。

Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) is of great significance for
the protection of marine diversity and national defense security. The
development of deep learning provides new opportunities for UATR, but faces
challenges brought by the scarcity of reference samples and complex
environmental interference. To address these issues, we proposes a multi-task
balanced channel attention convolutional neural network (MT-BCA-CNN). The
method integrates a channel attention mechanism with a multi-task learning
strategy, constructing a shared feature extractor and multi-task classifiers to
jointly optimize target classification and feature reconstruction tasks. The
channel attention mechanism dynamically enhances discriminative acoustic
features such as harmonic structures while suppressing noise. Experiments on
the Watkins Marine Life Dataset demonstrate that MT-BCA-CNN achieves 97\%
classification accuracy and 95\% $F1$-score in 27-class few-shot scenarios,
significantly outperforming traditional CNN and ACNN models, as well as popular
state-of-the-art UATR methods. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic
benefits of multi-task learning and attention mechanisms, while a dynamic
weighting adjustment strategy effectively balances task contributions. This
work provides an efficient solution for few-shot underwater acoustic
recognition, advancing research in marine bioacoustics and sonar signal
processing.

Motivation: AI天气模型存在系统偏差和可靠性问题，类似于传统NWP模型，因此需要验证现有后处理系统是否适用于AI模型，以低风险方式整合。

Method: 使用气象局的IMPROVER系统对ECMWF的AIFS进行后处理，并与HRES和ENS模型的输出比较，未修改任何配置或工作流程。

Result: 后处理对AIFS的准确性改善与对传统NWP相当，混合AIFS和NWP模型能提升整体预测技能。

Conclusion: 统计后处理方法直接适用于AI模型，允许国家气象中心以增量方式安全整合AI预测。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are now reaching
operational-grade performance for some variables, but like traditional
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they exhibit systematic biases and
reliability issues. We test the application of the Bureau of Meteorology's
existing statistical post-processing system, IMPROVER, to ECMWF's deterministic
Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), and compare results against
post-processed outputs from the ECMWF HRES and ENS models. Without any
modification to configuration or processing workflows, post-processing yields
comparable accuracy improvements for AIFS as for traditional NWP forecasts, in
both expected value and probabilistic outputs. We show that blending AIFS with
NWP models improves overall forecast skill, even when AIFS alone is not the
most accurate component. These findings show that statistical post-processing
methods developed for NWP are directly applicable to AI models, enabling
national meteorological centres to incorporate AI forecasts into existing
workflows in a low-risk, incremental fashion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解高维反射Hamiltonian Monte Carlo在特定初始化条件下混合缓慢的主要机制。

Method: 使用Sinkhorn散度量化非均匀性，在球体和立方体中分析集体运动行为，构建低维玩具模型，并与精确Hamiltonian粒子流对比。

Result: 发现运动在流体状和离散化主导行为之间转换，临界步长随维度幂律缩放，粒子可能自发分离导致密度共振，玩具模型再现关键特征。

Conclusion: 对比精确Hamiltonian粒子流，讨论动态调优实践以改善混合问题。

Abstract: In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact
reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from
a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By
quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the
Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the
mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion
transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the
critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes,
the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle
density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy
models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of
the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the
exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.

Result: 结果显示保留后验收缩性质、提供鲁棒性保证、建立变分Bernstein-von Mises定理，并在实验中验证性能。

Conclusion: 结论是该框架为复杂污染数据集的贝叶斯推理提供可靠工具。

Abstract: We propose a robust and scalable framework for variational Bayes (VB) that
effectively handles outliers and contamination of arbitrary nature in large
datasets. Our approach divides the dataset into disjoint subsets, computes the
posterior for each subset, and applies VB approximation independently to these
posteriors. The resulting variational posteriors with respect to the subsets
are then aggregated using the geometric median of probability measures,
computed with respect to the Wasserstein distance. This novel aggregation
method yields the Variational Median Posterior (VM-Posterior) distribution. We
rigorously demonstrate that the VM-Posterior preserves contraction properties
akin to those of the true posterior, while accounting for approximation errors
or the variational gap inherent in VB methods. We also provide provable
robustness guarantee of the VM-Posterior. Furthermore, we establish a
variational Bernstein-von Mises theorem for both multivariate Gaussian
distributions with general covariance structures and the mean-field variational
family. To facilitate practical implementation, we adapt existing algorithms
for computing the VM-Posterior and evaluate its performance through extensive
numerical experiments. The results highlight its robustness and scalability,
making it a reliable tool for Bayesian inference in the presence of complex,
contaminated datasets.

Conclusion: 解决了无界密度比问题，推进了理论前沿。

Abstract: Spectral algorithms leverage spectral regularization techniques to analyze
and process data, providing a flexible framework for addressing supervised
learning problems. To deepen our understanding of their performance in
real-world scenarios where the distributions of training and test data may
differ, we conduct a rigorous investigation into the convergence behavior of
spectral algorithms under distribution shifts, specifically within the
framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our study focuses on the case
of covariate shift. In this scenario, the marginal distributions of the input
data differ between the training and test datasets, while the conditional
distribution of the output given the input remains unchanged. Under this
setting, we analyze the generalization error of spectral algorithms and show
that they achieve minimax optimality when the density ratios between the
training and test distributions are uniformly bounded. However, we also
identify a critical limitation: when the density ratios are unbounded, the
spectral algorithms may become suboptimal. To address this limitation, we
propose a weighted spectral algorithm that incorporates density ratio
information into the learning process. Our theoretical analysis shows that this
weighted approach achieves optimal capacity-independent convergence rates.
Furthermore, by introducing a weight clipping technique, we demonstrate that
the convergence rates of the weighted spectral algorithm can approach the
optimal capacity-dependent convergence rates arbitrarily closely. This
improvement resolves the suboptimality issue in unbounded density ratio
scenarios and advances the state-of-the-art by refining existing theoretical
results.

Motivation: 动机是整合先前提及的随机化减少方差、正则化以及在低SNR环境下的作用，并系统分析MSE。

Method: 方法包括基于常见数据生成过程的系统分析和模拟研究，考察SNR及其他数据特性的影响。

Result: 结果显示方差减少随SNR增加，随机森林在低SNR时优于bagging；随机化在肥尾分布时可能增加偏差，在无关协变量时无效，在协变量相关时有效；平均方法可显著减少偏差。

Conclusion: 结论是这有助于更好地理解随机森林在实际应用中的表现，尤其是在协变量相关的场景下。

Abstract: We study the effectiveness of randomizing split-directions in random forests.
Prior literature has shown that, on the one hand, randomization can reduce
variance through decorrelation, and, on the other hand, randomization
regularizes and works in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. First,
we bring together and revisit decorrelation and regularization by presenting a
systematic analysis of out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) for different SNR
scenarios based on commonly-used data-generating processes. We find that
variance reduction tends to increase with the SNR and forests outperform
bagging when the SNR is low because, in low SNR cases, variance dominates bias
for both methods. Second, we show that the effectiveness of randomization is a
question that goes beyond the SNR. We present a simulation study with fixed and
moderate SNR, in which we examine the effectiveness of randomization for other
data characteristics. In particular, we find that (i) randomization can
increase bias in the presence of fat tails in the distribution of covariates;
(ii) in the presence of irrelevant covariates randomization is ineffective
because bias dominates variance; and (iii) when covariates are mutually
correlated randomization tends to be effective because variance dominates bias.
Beyond randomization, we find that, for both bagging and random forests, bias
can be significantly reduced in the presence of correlated covariates. This
last finding goes beyond the prevailing view that averaging mostly works by
variance reduction. Given that in practice covariates are often correlated, our
findings on correlated covariates could open the way for a better understanding
of why random forests work well in many applications.

Motivation: 动机是精确界定神经网络训练中多项式宽度与无限宽度间的逼近差距，特别是通过均值场动态分析其增长因素。

Method: 方法是通过投影梯度下降在均值场尺度下训练，利用由均值场动态控制的微分方程，并分析粒子的局部Hessian。

Result: 结果是，由于自协调属性，多项式数量神经元足以逼近均值场动态，收敛时间在环境维度上多项式增长。

Conclusion: 结论是，在特定特征学习问题中，有限宽度神经网络可有效模拟无限宽度行为。

Abstract: We study the approximation gap between the dynamics of a polynomial-width
neural network and its infinite-width counterpart, both trained using projected
gradient descent in the mean-field scaling regime. We demonstrate how to
tightly bound this approximation gap through a differential equation governed
by the mean-field dynamics. A key factor influencing the growth of this ODE is
the local Hessian of each particle, defined as the derivative of the particle's
velocity in the mean-field dynamics with respect to its position. We apply our
results to the canonical feature learning problem of estimating a
well-specified single-index model; we permit the information exponent to be
arbitrarily large, leading to convergence times that grow polynomially in the
ambient dimension $d$. We show that, due to a certain ``self-concordance''
property in these problems -- where the local Hessian of a particle is bounded
by a constant times the particle's velocity -- polynomially many neurons are
sufficient to closely approximate the mean-field dynamics throughout training.

Conclusion: 该框架为政策制定者提供新见解，并为未来多模态SDG应用奠定基础。

Abstract: From 2000 to 2015, the UN's Millennium Development Goals guided global
priorities. The subsequent Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted a more
dynamic approach, with annual indicator updates. As 2030 nears and progress
lags, innovative acceleration strategies are critical. This study develops an
AI-powered knowledge graph system to analyze SDG interconnections, discover
potential new goals, and visualize them online. Using official SDG texts,
Elsevier's keyword dataset, and 1,127 TED Talk transcripts (2020-2023), a pilot
on 269 talks from 2023 applies AI-speculative design, large language models,
and retrieval-augmented generation. Key findings include: (1) Heatmap analysis
reveals strong associations between Goal 10 and Goal 16, and minimal coverage
of Goal 6. (2) In the knowledge graph, simulated dialogue over time reveals new
central nodes, showing how richer data supports divergent thinking and goal
clarity. (3) Six potential new goals are proposed, centered on equity,
resilience, and technology-driven inclusion. This speculative-AI framework
offers fresh insights for policymakers and lays groundwork for future
multimodal and cross-system SDG applications.

<details>

Motivation: AI进展引发公众关注和担忧，AI对齐问题重要，但对跨国公众期望知之甚少，需要实证研究。

Method: 进行两项调查，样本包括德国1800人和美国1756人，考察对准确性、安全性、偏见缓解和理想化想象的支持。

Result: 美国受访者AI使用率和支持度更高；两国均优先支持准确性和安全性，公平性和理想化想象支持较弱；AI使用和言论自由态度影响因国家而异。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于AI治理辩论，强调基于公众态度的实证研究在理论和政策中的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence have raised public
awareness, shaping expectations and concerns about their societal implications.
Central to these debates is the question of AI alignment -- how well AI systems
meet public expectations regarding safety, fairness, and social values.
However, little is known about what people expect from AI-enabled systems and
how these expectations differ across national contexts. We present evidence
from two surveys of public preferences for key functional features of
AI-enabled systems in Germany (n = 1800) and the United States (n = 1756). We
examine support for four types of alignment in AI moderation: accuracy and
reliability, safety, bias mitigation, and the promotion of aspirational
imaginaries. U.S. respondents report significantly higher AI use and
consistently greater support for all alignment features, reflecting broader
technological openness and higher societal involvement with AI. In both
countries, accuracy and safety enjoy the strongest support, while more
normatively charged goals -- like fairness and aspirational imaginaries --
receive more cautious backing, particularly in Germany. We also explore how
individual experience with AI, attitudes toward free speech, political
ideology, partisan affiliation, and gender shape these preferences. AI use and
free speech support explain more variation in Germany. In contrast, U.S.
responses show greater attitudinal uniformity, suggesting that higher exposure
to AI may consolidate public expectations. These findings contribute to debates
on AI governance and cross-national variation in public preferences. More
broadly, our study demonstrates the value of empirically grounding AI alignment
debates in public attitudes and of explicitly developing normatively grounded
expectations into theoretical and policy discussions on the governance of
AI-generated content.

Motivation: 大规模枪击事件产生非结构化数据，缺乏自动化提取工具，本文旨在通过NER支持调查和政策制定。

Method: 使用LLM（如GPT-4o和o1-mini）通过少样本提示进行NER，识别罪犯、受害者、地点和犯罪工具等实体。

Result: GPT-4o在微精度、召回和F1分数上最高，o1-mini高效，增加样本数显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LLM在NER任务中有效，推荐根据资源选择GPT-4o或o1-mini。

Abstract: Mass-shooting events pose a significant challenge to public safety,
generating large volumes of unstructured textual data that hinder effective
investigations and the formulation of public policy. Despite the urgency, few
prior studies have effectively automated the extraction of key information from
these events to support legal and investigative efforts. This paper presented
the first dataset designed for knowledge acquisition on mass-shooting events
through the application of named entity recognition (NER) techniques. It
focuses on identifying key entities such as offenders, victims, locations, and
criminal instruments, that are vital for legal and investigative purposes. The
NER process is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using few-shot
prompting, facilitating the efficient extraction and organization of critical
information from diverse sources, including news articles, police reports, and
social media. Experimental results on real-world mass-shooting corpora
demonstrate that GPT-4o is the most effective model for mass-shooting NER,
achieving the highest Micro Precision, Micro Recall, and Micro F1-scores.
Meanwhile, o1-mini delivers competitive performance, making it a
resource-efficient alternative for less complex NER tasks. It is also observed
that increasing the shot count enhances the performance of all models, but the
gains are more substantial for GPT-4o and o1-mini, highlighting their superior
adaptability to few-shot learning scenarios.

Result: 在实际和模拟研究中，TransST显著改善现有方法，如乳腺癌研究中识别细胞簇并区分组织。

Conclusion: TransST在识别细胞亚群和检测驱动生物标志物方面有效且鲁棒。

Abstract: Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in
biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts
and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest.
However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution
and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably
extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge,
we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to
adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in
inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.
  Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of
simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing
techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully
identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two
subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is
able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the
studied methods.
  Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and
robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving
biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to new domains with few labeled
samples remains a significant challenge due to severe overfitting and
computational constraints. State-of-the-art solutions, such as low-rank
reparameterization, mitigate these issues but often struggle with
generalization and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, a
novel Sparse Optimization (SO) framework is proposed. Unlike low-rank
approaches that typically constrain updates to a fixed subspace, our SO method
leverages high sparsity to dynamically adjust very few parameters. We introduce
two key paradigms. First, we advocate for \textit{local sparsity and global
density}, which updates a minimal subset of parameters per iteration while
maintaining overall model expressiveness. As a second paradigm, we advocate for
\textit{local randomness and global importance}, which sparsifies the gradient
using random selection while pruning the first moment based on importance. This
combination significantly mitigates overfitting and ensures stable adaptation
in low-data regimes. Extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets show that SO
achieves state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation performance while reducing memory
overhead.

Motivation: 现有视频语言预训练模型计算需求高，不适合边缘设备，且仅处理短视频片段，因此需要高效的自适应解决方案。

Method: 提出AdaVid框架，使用受Matryoshka Representation Learning启发的自适应transformer块调整嵌入维度，并在Ego4D数据集上训练；同时引入轻量级分层网络处理长视频。

Result: AdaVid-EgoVLP在短视频基准上使用一半计算量与EgoVLP相当，或在相同资源下优于EgoVLP；在Diving48基准上允许更多帧处理，且分层网络在长视频基准上实现高效准确平衡。

Conclusion: AdaVid框架提升了视频编码的计算效率和适应性，在资源受限场景中表现出强性能。

Abstract: Contrastive video-language pretraining has demonstrated great success in
learning rich and robust video representations. However, deploying such video
encoders on compute-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to their
high computational demands. Additionally, existing models are typically trained
to process only short video clips, often limited to 4 to 64 frames. In this
paper, we introduce AdaVid, a flexible architectural framework designed to
learn efficient video encoders that can dynamically adapt their computational
footprint based on available resources. At the heart of AdaVid is an adaptive
transformer block, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, which allows
the model to adjust its hidden embedding dimension at inference time. We show
that AdaVid-EgoVLP, trained on video-narration pairs from the large-scale Ego4D
dataset, matches the performance of the standard EgoVLP on short video-language
benchmarks using only half the compute, and even outperforms EgoVLP when given
equal computational resources. We further explore the trade-off between frame
count and compute on the challenging Diving48 classification benchmark, showing
that AdaVid enables the use of more frames without exceeding computational
limits. To handle longer videos, we also propose a lightweight hierarchical
network that aggregates short clip features, achieving a strong balance between
compute efficiency and accuracy across several long video benchmarks.

sonographer and a high-quality ultrasound imaging device, which are generally
only available in hospitals. Recently, AI-based navigation models and
algorithms have been used to aid novice sonographers in acquiring the
standardized cardiac views necessary to visualize potential disease
pathologies. These navigation systems typically rely on directional guidance to
predict the necessary rotation of the ultrasound probe. This paper demonstrates
a novel AI navigation system that builds on a decision model for identifying
the inferior vena cava (IVC) of the heart. The decision model is trained
offline using cardiac ultrasound videos and employs binary classification to
determine whether the IVC is present in a given ultrasound video. The
underlying model integrates a novel localization algorithm that leverages the
learned feature representations to annotate the spatial location of the IVC in
real-time. Our model demonstrates strong localization performance on
traditional high-quality hospital ultrasound videos, as well as impressive
zero-shot performance on lower-quality ultrasound videos from a more affordable
Butterfly iQ handheld ultrasound machine. This capability facilitates the
expansion of ultrasound diagnostics beyond hospital settings. Currently, the
guidance system is undergoing clinical trials and is available on the Butterfly
iQ app.

Motivation: 手术室工作流程优化需要隐私保护的计算机视觉方法，以减少成本、改善患者结果并识别瓶颈。

Method: 提出一个两阶段管道：第一阶段使用视觉基础模型进行深度估计和语义分割生成去标识化数字孪生；第二阶段使用SafeOR模型处理分割掩码和深度图进行事件检测。

Result: 在38个模拟手术试验数据集上，数字孪生方法在事件检测性能上与原始RGB视频方法相当或更好。

Conclusion: 数字孪生启用隐私保护的工作流程分析，促进跨机构数据共享，并可能提高模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Purpose: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing
workflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. The use of
computer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative
events enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However,
privacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection
from OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR
workflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for
privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage,
we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic
segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from
conventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a
fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for
OR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38
simulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results
indicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves
performance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on
detecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow
analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions
and they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating
domain-specific appearance differences.

Result: 在五个下游任务上进行的广泛实验证明了CM3AE的有效性。

Conclusion: CM3AE框架为事件-based和RGB-事件融合下游任务提供了稳健支持，源代码将在GitHub上发布。

Abstract: Event cameras have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to
their advantages in high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, low power
consumption, and low latency. Some researchers have begun exploring
pre-training directly on event data. Nevertheless, these efforts often fail to
establish strong connections with RGB frames, limiting their applicability in
multi-modal fusion scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel CM3AE
pre-training framework for the RGB-Event perception. This framework accepts
multi-modalities/views of data as input, including RGB images, event images,
and event voxels, providing robust support for both event-based and RGB-event
fusion based downstream tasks. Specifically, we design a multi-modal fusion
reconstruction module that reconstructs the original image from fused
multi-modal features, explicitly enhancing the model's ability to aggregate
cross-modal complementary information. Additionally, we employ a multi-modal
contrastive learning strategy to align cross-modal feature representations in a
shared latent space, which effectively enhances the model's capability for
multi-modal understanding and capturing global dependencies. We construct a
large-scale dataset containing 2,535,759 RGB-Event data pairs for the
pre-training. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks fully demonstrated
the effectiveness of CM3AE. Source code and pre-trained models will be released
on https://github.com/Event-AHU/CM3AE.

Conclusion: 方法有效且鲁棒，将发布源代码和模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method named Robo-SGG, i.e.,
Layout-Oriented Normalization and Restitution for Robust Scene Graph
Generation. Compared to the existing SGG setting, the robust scene graph
generation aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images,
with the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted
images. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to
compromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To
obtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is
domain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted
images. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization(IN) to filter out the
domain-specific feature and recover the unchangeable structural features, i.e.,
the positional and semantic relationships among objects by the proposed
Layout-Oriented Restitution. Additionally, we propose a Layout-Embedded Encoder
(LEE) that augments the existing object and predicate encoders within the SGG
framework, enriching the robust positional and semantic features of objects and
predicates. Note that our proposed Robo-SGG module is designed as a
plug-and-play component, which can be easily integrated into any baseline SGG
model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating the
state-of-the-art method into our proposed Robo-SGG, we achieve relative
improvements of 5.6%, 8.0%, and 6.5% in mR@50 for PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet
tasks on the VG-C dataset, respectively, and achieve new state-of-the-art
performance in corruption scene graph generation benchmark (VG-C and GQA-C). We
will release our source code and model.

Motivation: 现有机器学习算法忽略地理空间元数据，导致大规模土地覆盖映射的准确性和可扩展性不足。

Method: 提出BRIDGE-LC框架，使用轻量级多层感知器整合细粒度（经纬度）和粗粒度（生物地理区域）信息，训练时使用两者，推理时仅需细粒度信息。

Result: 实验显示，整合地理空间信息提升了性能，尤其在联合使用多尺度信息时，并在外推和留一区域外场景中验证。

Conclusion: 整合多尺度地理空间信息显著改善土地覆盖映射性能，最大收益来自同时利用细粒度和粗粒度信息。

Abstract: Land use and land cover mapping from Earth Observation (EO) data is a
critical tool for sustainable land and resource management. While advanced
machine learning and deep learning algorithms excel at analyzing EO imagery
data, they often overlook crucial geospatial metadata information that could
enhance scalability and accuracy across regional, continental, and global
scales. To address this limitation, we propose BRIDGE-LC (Bi-level
Representation Integration for Disentangled GEospatial Land Cover), a novel
deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale geospatial information into
the land cover classification process. By simultaneously leveraging
fine-grained (latitude/longitude) and coarse-grained (biogeographical region)
spatial information, our lightweight multi-layer perceptron architecture learns
from both during training but only requires fine-grained information for
inference, allowing it to disentangle region-specific from region-agnostic land
cover features while maintaining computational efficiency. To assess the
quality of our framework, we use an open-access in-situ dataset and adopt
several competing classification approaches commonly considered for large-scale
land cover mapping. We evaluated all approaches through two scenarios: an
extrapolation scenario in which training data encompasses samples from all
biogeographical regions, and a leave-one-region-out scenario where one region
is excluded from training. We also explore the spatial representation learned
by our model, highlighting a connection between its internal manifold and the
geographical information used during training. Our results demonstrate that
integrating geospatial information improves land cover mapping performance,
with the most substantial gains achieved by jointly leveraging both fine- and
coarse-grained spatial information.

TL;DR: CLIP-Refine 是一种后预训练方法，通过1个周期的训练在小数据集上对CLIP模型进行特征对齐，减少模态间差距，同时不降低零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型的模态间差距限制了下游任务性能，现有的方法要么训练成本高，要么导致零样本性能下降。

Method: 引入随机特征对齐(RaFA)和混合对比蒸馏(HyCD)技术，RaFA通过最小化特征与随机参考向量的距离对齐特征，HyCD使用混合软标签结合真实标签和预训练CLIP输出更新模型。

Result: 在多个分类和检索任务的实验中，CLIP-Refine成功缓解模态间差距，提高了零样本性能。

Conclusion: CLIP-Refine方法在保持原有知识的同时，学习新知识对齐特征，取得了积极效果。

Abstract: Contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) is an essential component of
building modern vision-language foundation models. While CLIP demonstrates
remarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature
spaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text
feature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing
works attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or
fine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or
degradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a
post-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and
fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training
on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To
this end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and
hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features
to follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random
reference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid
soft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and
outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both
maintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features.
Our extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show
that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the
zero-shot performance.

Method: 引入主动学习，让DNNs基于现有数据集选择新数据中最具信息性的部分，并使用深度特征距离作为衡量标准。

Result: 实验显示，使用主动学习选择一半数据时，DNNs的mIoU达到0.4349，与全数据集的0.4374几乎相当。

Conclusion: 主动学习有效减少数据标注需求，同时维持性能，证明其在医疗图像处理中的潜力。

Abstract: Labeling has always been expensive in the medical context, which has hindered
related deep learning application. Our work introduces active learning in
surgical video frame selection to construct a high-quality, affordable
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy dataset for semantic segmentation. Active learning
allows the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learning pipeline to include the dataset
construction workflow, which means DNNs trained by existing dataset will
identify the most informative data from the newly collected data. At the same
time, DNNs' performance and generalization ability improve over time when the
newly selected and annotated data are included in the training data. We
assessed different data informativeness measurements and found the deep
features distances select the most informative data in this task. Our
experiments show that with half of the data selected by active learning, the
DNNs achieve almost the same performance with 0.4349 mean Intersection over
Union (mIoU) compared to the same DNNs trained on the full dataset (0.4374
mIoU) on the critical anatomies and surgical instruments.

Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法存在局限性，anchor-free方法可能导致视觉 artifacts，anchor-based方法依赖启发式锚点选择，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: ANT框架逆转classifier-free guidance条件方向，在中后期去噪阶段精确修改内容，使用轨迹感知目标函数和augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map进行单多概念擦除。

Result: ANT在单概念和多概念擦除中达到state-of-the-art结果，生成高质量、安全输出。

Conclusion: ANT框架提供高效、可靠的概念擦除方法，克服现有方法的缺点。

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective
techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While
concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based
approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting
sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods
rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these
shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which
Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is
built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free
guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content
modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This
inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the
early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image
manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For
single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map
to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly
contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient
erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile
plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both
single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without
compromising the generative fidelity. Code is available at

Abstract: Pap smear image segmentation is crucial for cervical cancer diagnosis.
However, traditional segmentation models often struggle with complex cellular
structures and variations in pap smear images. This study proposes a hybrid
Dense-UNet201 optimization approach that integrates a pretrained DenseNet201 as
the encoder for the U-Net architecture and optimizes it using the spider monkey
optimization (SMO) algorithm. The Dense-UNet201 model excelled at feature
extraction. The SMO was modified to handle categorical and discrete parameters.
The SIPaKMeD dataset was used in this study and evaluated using key performance
metrics, including loss, accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice
coefficient. The experimental results showed that Dense-UNet201 outperformed
U-Net, Res-UNet50, and Efficient-UNetB0. SMO Dense-UNet201 achieved a

Abstract: We present a novel approach to training specialized instruction-based
image-editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in structural
preservation with input images and semantic alignment with user prompts. We
introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion
model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or
curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the realism and
alignment with instructions in two ways. First, the proposed models achieve
precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while
maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. Second, they capture
fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling
detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. This
approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring
only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental
results demonstrate that our models can perform intricate edits in complex
scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of
our method by applying it to robotics, where enhancing the visual realism of
simulated environments through targeted sim-to-real image edits improves their
utility as proxies for real-world settings.

Motivation: CNN经常学习多义通道，这些通道编码不同概念，难以解释，从而给机制解释性研究带来挑战。

Result: 提高了CNN的可解释性，并改善了特征可视化等解释技术。

Conclusion: 最终增强了神经网络的解释能力。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability is concerned with analyzing individual
components in a (convolutional) neural network (CNN) and how they form larger
circuits representing decision mechanisms. These investigations are challenging
since CNNs frequently learn polysemantic channels that encode distinct
concepts, making them hard to interpret. To address this, we propose an
algorithm to disentangle a specific kind of polysemantic channel into multiple
channels, each responding to a single concept. Our approach restructures
weights in a CNN, utilizing that different concepts within the same channel
exhibit distinct activation patterns in the previous layer. By disentangling
these polysemantic features, we enhance the interpretability of CNNs,
ultimately improving explanatory techniques such as feature visualizations.

Conclusion: 通过语言作为桥梁域，改善了跨域泛化性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization aims at training on source domains to uncover a
domain-invariant feature space, allowing the model to perform robust
generalization ability on unknown target domains. However, due to domain gaps,
it is hard to find reliable common image feature space, and the reason for that
is the lack of suitable basic units for images. Different from image in vision
space, language has comprehensive expression elements that can effectively
convey semantics. Inspired by the semantic completeness of language and
intuitiveness of image, we propose VLCA, which combine language space and
vision space, and connect the multiple image domains by using semantic space as
the bridge domain. Specifically, in language space, by taking advantage of the
completeness of language basic units, we tend to capture the semantic
representation of the relations between categories through word vector
distance. Then, in vision space, by taking advantage of the intuitiveness of
image features, the common pattern of sample features with the same class is
explored through low-rank approximation. In the end, the language
representation is aligned with the vision representation through the multimodal
space of text and image. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable
Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed
images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur
users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's
work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright
infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually
imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles
(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in
the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model
has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model
retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.
  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the
text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to
identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of
specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely,
ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style
representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then,
ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions.
The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that
ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying
ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights
into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario. ArtistAuditor

Abstract: We propose a method to transfer pose and expression between face images.
Given a source and target face portrait, the model produces an output image in
which the pose and expression of the source face image are transferred onto the
target identity. The architecture consists of two encoders and a mapping
network that projects the two inputs into the latent space of StyleGAN2, which
finally generates the output. The training is self-supervised from video
sequences of many individuals. Manual labeling is not required. Our model
enables the synthesis of random identities with controllable pose and
expression. Close-to-real-time performance is achieved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解决检索系统中准确性和效率的权衡问题，尤其在部分相关视频检索中，增加多样上下文提升准确性但会增加计算和内存成本。

Method: 方法包括将视频多样上下文编码成固定原型，引入文本关联和视频理解策略，使用跨模态和单模态重建任务，以及视频混合技术对齐原型和文本表示。

Result: 结果显示，在TVR、ActivityNet-Captions和QVHighlights数据集上的评估验证了方法的有效性，而不牺牲效率。

Conclusion: 结论是，该框架成功实现了高准确性和高效性的平衡。

Abstract: In a retrieval system, simultaneously achieving search accuracy and
efficiency is inherently challenging. This challenge is particularly pronounced
in partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), where incorporating more diverse
context representations at varying temporal scales for each video enhances
accuracy but increases computational and memory costs. To address this
dichotomy, we propose a prototypical PRVR framework that encodes diverse
contexts within a video into a fixed number of prototypes. We then introduce
several strategies to enhance text association and video understanding within
the prototypes, along with an orthogonal objective to ensure that the
prototypes capture a diverse range of content. To keep the prototypes
searchable via text queries while accurately encoding video contexts, we
implement cross- and uni-modal reconstruction tasks. The cross-modal
reconstruction task aligns the prototypes with textual features within a shared
space, while the uni-modal reconstruction task preserves all video contexts
during encoding. Additionally, we employ a video mixing technique to provide
weak guidance to further align prototypes and associated textual
representations. Extensive evaluations on TVR, ActivityNet-Captions, and
QVHighlights validate the effectiveness of our approach without sacrificing
efficiency.

Motivation: 解决大型视频模型在视频理解中与人类直觉不一致以及视频幻觉问题。

Method: 引入VistaDPO框架，在实例级、时间级和感知级优化偏好对齐，并构建VistaDPO-7k数据集（7.2K QA对）。

Result: 实验显示，VistaDPO在视频幻觉、问答和字幕生成基准上显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: VistaDPO有效地缓解视频-语言不对齐和幻觉问题，提升了大型视频模型的表现。

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human
intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we
introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal
Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference
alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall
video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal
semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial
objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained
video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of
7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with
spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and
bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video
Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that
VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively
mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/HaroldChen19/VistaDPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模糊视频超分辨率方法无法有效恢复高分辨率细节，原因在于运动信息不足和低分辨率帧缺乏高频细节。

Method: 提出事件增强网络Ev-DeblurVSR，包括互惠特征去模糊模块和混合可变形对齐模块，利用事件信号与帧信息融合。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到新最先进性能，比FMA-Net准确性提高2.59 dB，速度提升7.28倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效改善了模糊视频超分辨率的性能，建立了新的基准。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of blurry video super-resolution (BVSR),
aiming to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) and
blurry inputs. Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high
resolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient
motion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in
LR frames. To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR
and propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR. To effectively fuse
information from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a
reciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from
intra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global
scene context from the frames to enhance event features. Furthermore, to
enhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module
that fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame
events and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable
alignment process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. Notably, on real data, our method is +2.59 dB more accurate and
7.28$\times$ faster than the recent best BVSR baseline FMA-Net. Code:

Abstract: We present a novel approach to integrating scientific knowledge into
generative models, enhancing their realism and consistency in image synthesis.
First, we introduce Science-T2I, an expert-annotated adversarial dataset
comprising adversarial 20k image pairs with 9k prompts, covering wide distinct
scientific knowledge categories. Leveraging Science-T2I, we present SciScore,
an end-to-end reward model that refines the assessment of generated images
based on scientific knowledge, which is achieved by augmenting both the
scientific comprehension and visual capabilities of pre-trained CLIP model.
Additionally, based on SciScore, we propose a two-stage training framework,
comprising a supervised fine-tuning phase and a masked online fine-tuning
phase, to incorporate scientific knowledge into existing generative models.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in establishing new standards for evaluating the scientific realism
of generated content. Specifically, SciScore attains performance comparable to
human-level, demonstrating a 5% improvement similar to evaluations conducted by
experienced human evaluators. Furthermore, by applying our proposed fine-tuning
method to FLUX, we achieve a performance enhancement exceeding 50% on SciScore.

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many
high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and
training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation
from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark
results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without
knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific
progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a
Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for
transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard
training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore
large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in
detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M
human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and
spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce
PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks
focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a
video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes,
code & models.

Motivation: 动机是解决从穿着者身上提取服装图像的挑战，并减少p2p-VTON中的不想要属性转移，提升时尚领域的计算机视觉应用。

Method: 方法是使用潜扩散框架和SigLIP图像条件，结合类别特定嵌入，实现多服装VTOFF模型。

Conclusion: 结论是TryOffDiff是首个多服装VTOFF模型，推动了虚拟试穿技术的发展，代码已开源。

Abstract: Computer vision is transforming fashion through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and
Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified
garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more
challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo
of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, on the other hand, extracts
standardized garment images from clothed individuals. We introduce TryOffDiff,
a diffusion-based VTOFF model. Built on a latent diffusion framework with
SigLIP image conditioning, it effectively captures garment properties like
texture, shape, and patterns. TryOffDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on
VITON-HD and strong performance on DressCode dataset, covering upper-body,
lower-body, and dresses. Enhanced with class-specific embeddings, it pioneers
multi-garment VTOFF, the first of its kind. When paired with VTON models, it
improves p2p-VTON by minimizing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin
color. Code is available at: https://rizavelioglu.github.io/tryoffdiff/

Motivation: 探讨视觉语言模型是否真正具有组合创造力，还是仅为训练数据的模式匹配，受认知科学启发。

Method: 提出识别-解释-含义（IEI）框架，构建包含666个艺术混搭的CreativeMashup数据集，并通过实验验证模型在理解和生成任务中的表现。

Result: 在理解任务中，顶级VLM超过平均人类水平但不及专家；在生成任务中，融入IEI框架显著提高创造质量。

Conclusion: 为评估人工智能创造力建立理论基础，并提供改进VLM生成创造性的实用指南。

Abstract: The ability to combine existing concepts into novel ideas stands as a
fundamental hallmark of human intelligence. Recent advances in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) like GPT-4V and DALLE-3 have sparked debate about whether their
outputs reflect combinational creativity--defined by M. A. Boden (1998) as
synthesizing novel ideas through combining existing concepts--or sophisticated
pattern matching of training data. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science,
we investigate the combinational creativity of VLMs from the lens of concept
blending. We propose the Identification-Explanation-Implication (IEI)
framework, which decomposes creative processes into three levels: identifying
input spaces, extracting shared attributes, and deriving novel semantic
implications. To validate this framework, we curate CreativeMashup, a
high-quality dataset of 666 artist-generated visual mashups annotated according
to the IEI framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in
comprehension tasks, best VLMs have surpassed average human performance while
falling short of expert-level understanding; in generation tasks, incorporating
our IEI framework into the generation pipeline significantly enhances the
creative quality of VLMs outputs. Our findings establish both a theoretical
foundation for evaluating artificial creativity and practical guidelines for
improving creative generation in VLMs.

Motivation: 高质量图像文本对数据稀缺和饱和，限制了视觉语言模型的进一步发展。

Method: 开发了生成高质量、低幻觉合成标题的管道，使用连续DPO方法，将非幻觉标题率从48.2%提高到77.9%。

Result: 在35个视觉语言任务中，性能提升至少6.2%，FID分数降低17.1和13.3，并发布Hunyuan-Recap100M数据集。

Conclusion: 低幻觉合成标题可作为真实数据的替代，并显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has
experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement
of textual capabilities in large language models. However, existing training
paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality
image-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the
availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce
and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.
This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for
vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale
low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a
viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)
achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language
models through empirical validation. This paper presents three key
contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,
low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO
methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,
the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2%
to 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals
that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their
counterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data
achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text
pairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support
in the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1
on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation
benchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and
knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.

TL;DR: 本文引入Complex-Edit基准，用于评估指令-based图像编辑模型在不同复杂性指令下的性能，并揭示了模型表现的关键洞见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了系统评估图像编辑模型的性能，尤其在复杂指令下的能力，使用GPT-4o自动生成多样化的编辑指令以填补现有评估的不足。

Method: 采用'Chain-of-Edit'管道：独立生成原子编辑任务，然后整合成复杂指令；引入多种指标和基于VLM的自动评估管道。

Result: 开源模型远逊于闭源模型，复杂度增加时差距扩大；复杂指令影响关键元素保留和美学质量；逐步执行指令降低性能；Best-of-N策略改善结果；合成数据训练导致编辑图像更合成化。

Conclusion: 复杂指令对模型提出挑战，强调需要改进模型以提升元素保留、美学质量和减少合成数据负面影响。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{Complex-Edit}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate instruction-based image editing models across
instructions of varying complexity. To develop this benchmark, we harness
GPT-4o to automatically collect a diverse set of editing instructions at scale.
Our approach follows a well-structured ``Chain-of-Edit'' pipeline: we first
generate individual atomic editing tasks independently and then integrate them
to form cohesive, complex instructions. Additionally, we introduce a suite of
metrics to assess various aspects of editing performance, along with a
VLM-based auto-evaluation pipeline that supports large-scale assessments. Our
benchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly
underperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the
performance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased
instructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key
elements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality;
3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed
in a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple
metrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for
both direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe
a ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model
training, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly
synthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon
that intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs.

Abstract: Soft robots are increasingly used in healthcare, especially for assistive
care, due to their inherent safety and adaptability. Controlling soft robots is
challenging due to their nonlinear dynamics and the presence of time delays,
especially in applications like a soft robotic arm for patient care. This paper
presents a learning-based approach to approximate the nonlinear state predictor
(Smith Predictor), aiming to improve tracking performance in a two-module soft
robot arm with a short inherent input delay. The method uses Kernel Recursive
Least Squares Tracker (KRLST) for online learning of the system dynamics and a
Legendre Delay Network (LDN) to compress past input history for efficient delay
compensation. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in
tracking performance compared to a baseline model-based non-linear controller.
Statistical analysis confirms the significance of the improvements. The method
is computationally efficient and adaptable online, making it suitable for
real-world scenarios and highlighting its potential for enabling safer and more
accurate control of soft robots in assistive care applications.

Abstract: Accurately modeling friction in robotics remains a core challenge, as
robotics simulators like Mujoco and PyBullet use simplified friction models or
heuristics to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, where these
simplifications and approximations can lead to substantial differences between
simulated and physical performance. In this paper, we present a
physics-informed friction estimation framework that enables the integration of
well-established friction models with learnable components-requiring only
minimal, generic measurement data. Our approach enforces physical consistency
yet retains the flexibility to adapt to real-world complexities. We
demonstrate, on an underactuated and nonlinear system, that the learned
friction models, trained solely on small and noisy datasets, accurately
simulate dynamic friction properties and reduce the sim-to-real gap. Crucially,
we show that our approach enables the learned models to be transferable to
systems they are not trained on. This ability to generalize across multiple
systems streamlines friction modeling for complex, underactuated tasks,
offering a scalable and interpretable path toward bridging the sim-to-real gap
in robotics and control.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation robots are continuously advancing, with their grasping

preventing state-of-the-art mobile manipulators from widespread real-world

them in a real-world grocery store -- an exceptionally challenging setting
chosen for its vast diversity of manipulable items, fixtures, and layouts. In
this work, we present our detailed approach to designing general grasp
strategies towards picking any item in a real grocery store. Additionally, we
provide an in-depth analysis of our latest real-world field test, discussing
key findings related to fundamental failure modes over hundreds of distinct
pick attempts. Through our detailed analysis, we aim to offer valuable
practical insights and identify key grasping challenges, which can guide the
robotics community towards pressing open problems in the field.

Conclusion: 方法有效提高了路径规划的安全性和效率，适用于多样停车场景。

Abstract: Safe and efficient path planning in parking scenarios presents a significant
challenge due to the presence of cluttered environments filled with static and
dynamic obstacles. To address this, we propose a novel and computationally
efficient planning strategy that seamlessly integrates the predictions of
dynamic obstacles into the planning process, ensuring the generation of
collision-free paths. Our approach builds upon the conventional Hybrid A star
algorithm by introducing a time-indexed variant that explicitly accounts for
the predictions of dynamic obstacles during node exploration in the graph, thus
enabling dynamic obstacle avoidance. We integrate the time-indexed Hybrid A
star algorithm within an online planning framework to compute local paths at
each planning step, guided by an adaptively chosen intermediate goal. The
proposed method is validated in diverse parking scenarios, including
perpendicular, angled, and parallel parking. Through simulations, we showcase
our approach's potential in greatly improving the efficiency and safety when
compared to the state of the art spline-based planning method for parking
situations.

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to bias the driving style of an
artificial race driver (ARD) for online time-optimal trajectory planning. Our
method leverages a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework that
combines time minimization with exit speed maximization at the end of the
planning horizon. We introduce a new MPC terminal cost formulation based on the
trajectory planned in the previous MPC step, enabling ARD to adapt its driving
style from early to late apex maneuvers in real-time. Our approach is
computationally efficient, allowing for low replan times and long planning
horizons. We validate our method through simulations, comparing the results
against offline minimum-lap-time (MLT) optimal control and online minimum-time
MPC solutions. The results demonstrate that our new terminal cost enables ARD
to bias its driving style, and achieve online lap times close to the MLT
solution and faster than the minimum-time MPC solution. Our approach paves the
way for a better understanding of the reasons behind human drivers' choice of
early or late apex maneuvers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自监督学习和可微模型预测控制的框架，用于无人机姿态控制，提高了在复杂环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统控制方法性能次优，纯数据驱动方法效率低，混合方法提供更好替代以应对非线性动态和外部干扰。

Result: 在强风条件下有效，提升了MPC参数学习和IMU预测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法融合了学习-based感知和模型-based控制的优势，提供了一个鲁棒且高效的控制策略。

Abstract: Modeling and control of nonlinear dynamics are critical in robotics,
especially in scenarios with unpredictable external influences and complex
dynamics. Traditional cascaded modular control pipelines often yield suboptimal
performance due to conservative assumptions and tedious parameter tuning. Pure
data-driven approaches promise robust performance but suffer from low sample
efficiency, sim-to-real gaps, and reliance on extensive datasets. Hybrid
methods combining learning-based and traditional model-based control in an
end-to-end manner offer a promising alternative. This work presents a
self-supervised learning framework combining learning-based inertial odometry
(IO) module and differentiable model predictive control (d-MPC) for Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) attitude control. The IO denoises raw IMU measurements and
predicts UAV attitudes, which are then optimized by MPC for control actions in
a bi-level optimization (BLO) setup, where the inner MPC optimizes control
actions and the upper level minimizes discrepancy between real-world and
predicted performance. The framework is thus end-to-end and can be trained in a
self-supervised manner. This approach combines the strength of learning-based
perception with the interpretable model-based control. Results show the
effectiveness even under strong wind. It can simultaneously enhance both the
MPC parameter learning and IMU prediction performance.

Result: 结果是经验上紧凑的松弛，计算负担轻，并通过单个半定程序解决PWA最优控制问题。

Conclusion: 结论是有效处理非凸优化并扩展应用范围。

Abstract: We introduce a semidefinite relaxation for optimal control of linear systems
with time scaling. These problems are inherently nonconvex, since the system
dynamics involves bilinear products between the discretization time step and
the system state and controls. The proposed relaxation is closely related to
the standard second-order semidefinite relaxation for quadratic constraints,
but we carefully select a subset of the possible bilinear terms and apply a
change of variables to achieve empirically tight relaxations while keeping the
computational load light. We further extend our method to handle
piecewise-affine (PWA) systems by formulating the PWA optimal-control problem
as a shortest-path problem in a graph of convex sets (GCS). In this GCS,
different paths represent different mode sequences for the PWA system, and the
convex sets model the relaxed dynamics within each mode. By combining a tight
convex relaxation of the GCS problem with our semidefinite relaxation with time
scaling, we can solve PWA optimal-control problems through a single
semidefinite program.

Motivation: 解决机器人学习灵巧操作需大量演示数据的难题，利用易于收集的视频数据避免形态差异问题。

Method: 从视频提取对象位姿轨迹定义奖励函数和预操作手部姿势用于 RL 训练初始化和指导，无需可穿戴设备或远程操作。

Result: 在抓取、非 prehensile 操作和多步任务中，优于基线方法 55% 和 68%。

Conclusion: 证明了高效学习机器人操作的潜力，消除了任务特定奖励调整的需求。

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills often requires collecting
hundreds of demonstrations using wearables or teleoperation, a process that is
challenging to scale. Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect
and scale, but leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to
the lack of explicit action labels from videos and morphological differences
between robot and human hands. We propose Human2Sim2Robot, a novel
real-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies
using only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes
reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the human-robot embodiment
gap without relying on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection
typically necessary for imitation learning methods. From the demonstration, we
extract two task-specific components: (1) the object pose trajectory to define
an object-centric, embodiment-agnostic reward function, and (2) the
pre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration during RL
training. We found that these two components are highly effective for learning
the desired task, eliminating the need for task-specific reward shaping and
tuning. We demonstrate that Human2Sim2Robot outperforms object-aware open-loop
trajectory replay by 55% and imitation learning with data augmentation by 68%
across grasping, non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks. Project

Conclusion: 该模型成功处理感知混淆，提供多模态位置分布，提高了建筑工地机器人定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mobile robots on construction sites require accurate pose estimation to
perform autonomous surveying and inspection missions. Localization in
construction sites is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of
repetitive features such as flat plastered walls and perceptual aliasing due to
apartments with similar layouts inter and intra floors. In this paper, we focus
on the global re-positioning of a robot with respect to an accurate scanned
mesh of the building solely using LiDAR data. In our approach, a neural network
is trained on synthetic LiDAR point clouds generated by simulating a LiDAR in
an accurate real-life large-scale mesh. We train a diffusion model with a
PointNet++ backbone, which allows us to model multiple position candidates from
a single LiDAR point cloud. The resulting model can successfully predict the
global position of LiDAR in confined and complex sites despite the adverse
effects of perceptual aliasing. The learned distribution of potential global
positions can provide multi-modal position distribution. We evaluate our
approach across five real-world datasets and show the place recognition
accuracy of 77% +/-2m on average while outperforming baselines at a factor of 2
in mean error.

Abstract: Adapting robot trajectories based on human instructions as per new situations
is essential for achieving more intuitive and scalable human-robot
interactions. This work proposes a flexible language-based framework to adapt
generic robotic trajectories produced by off-the-shelf motion planners like
RRT, A-star, etc, or learned from human demonstrations. We utilize pre-trained
LLMs to adapt trajectory waypoints by generating code as a policy for dense
robot manipulation, enabling more complex and flexible instructions than
current methods. This approach allows us to incorporate a broader range of
commands, including numerical inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art
feature-based sequence-to-sequence models which require training, our method
does not require task-specific training and offers greater interpretability and
more effective feedback mechanisms. We validate our approach through simulation
experiments on the robotic manipulator, aerial vehicle, and ground robot in the
Pybullet and Gazebo simulation environments, demonstrating that LLMs can
successfully adapt trajectories to complex human instructions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of graph neural networks (GNNs) with
Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) for scene understanding in automated
driving. Scene understanding is the basis for any further reactive or proactive
decision-making. Scene understanding and related reasoning is inherently an
explanation task: why is another traffic participant doing something, what or
who caused their actions? While previous work demonstrated QXGs' effectiveness
using shallow machine learning models, these approaches were limited to
analysing single relation chains between object pairs, disregarding the broader
scene context. We propose a novel GNN architecture that processes entire graph
structures to identify relevant objects in traffic scenes. We evaluate our
method on the nuScenes dataset enriched with DriveLM's human-annotated
relevance labels. Experimental results show that our GNN-based approach
achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods. The model
effectively handles the inherent class imbalance in relevant object
identification tasks while considering the complete spatial-temporal
relationships between all objects in the scene. Our work demonstrates the
potential of combining qualitative representations with deep learning
approaches for explainable scene understanding in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of robotics, dual-arm coordination and complex
object manipulation are essential capabilities for developing advanced
autonomous systems. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality
demonstration data and real-world-aligned evaluation benchmarks severely limits
such development. To address this, we introduce RoboTwin, a generative digital
twin framework that uses 3D generative foundation models and large language
models to produce diverse expert datasets and provide a real-world-aligned
evaluation platform for dual-arm robotic tasks. Specifically, RoboTwin creates
varied digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and
interactive scenarios. It also introduces a spatial relation-aware code
generation framework that combines object annotations with large language
models to break down tasks, determine spatial constraints, and generate precise
robotic movement code. Our framework offers a comprehensive benchmark with both
simulated and real-world data, enabling standardized evaluation and better
alignment between simulated training and real-world performance. We validated
our approach using the open-source COBOT Magic Robot platform. Policies
pre-trained on RoboTwin-generated data and fine-tuned with limited real-world
samples demonstrate significant potential for enhancing dual-arm robotic
manipulation systems by improving success rates by over 70% for single-arm
tasks and over 40% for dual-arm tasks compared to models trained solely on
real-world data.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is a fundamental capability for robotic systems, yet
progress has been limited by hardware trade-offs between precision,
compactness, strength, and affordability. Existing control methods impose
compromises on hand designs and applications. However, learning-based
approaches present opportunities to rethink these trade-offs, particularly to
address challenges with tendon-driven actuation and low-cost materials. This
work presents RUKA, a tendon-driven humanoid hand that is compact, affordable,
and capable. Made from 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components, RUKA has
5 fingers with 15 underactuated degrees of freedom enabling diverse human-like
grasps. Its tendon-driven actuation allows powerful grasping in a compact,
human-sized form factor. To address control challenges, we learn
joint-to-actuator and fingertip-to-actuator models from motion-capture data
collected by the MANUS glove, leveraging the hand's morphological accuracy.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate RUKA's superior reachability, durability, and
strength compared to other robotic hands. Teleoperation tasks further showcase
RUKA's dexterous movements. The open-source design and assembly instructions of
RUKA, code, and data are available at https://ruka-hand.github.io/.

Abstract: Foundation models in digital pathology use massive datasets to learn useful
compact feature representations of complex histology images. However, there is
limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and
performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to
increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a
prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology
data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing
reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using
guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures
biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We
demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset
achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models
trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our
synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across
multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on
orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic
and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several
evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create
compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the
reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our
approach.

Conclusion: 该方法填补3D异常生成空白，促进工业质量检测研究。

Abstract: Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in
various vision tasks. However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity
of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models.
While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established
generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has
made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In
contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored,
limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address
this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS,
based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates
realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane,
sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the
point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization
experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale,
perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the
generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from
pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our
cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet
geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to
their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive
codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Accurate prediction and stabilization of blast furnace temperatures are
crucial for optimizing the efficiency and productivity of steel production.
Traditional methods often struggle with the complex and non-linear nature of
the temperature fluctuations within blast furnaces. This paper proposes a novel
approach that combines hybrid quantum machine learning with pulverized coal
injection control to address these challenges. By integrating classical machine
learning techniques with quantum computing algorithms, we aim to enhance
predictive accuracy and achieve more stable temperature control. For this we
utilized a unique prediction-based optimization method. Our method leverages
quantum-enhanced feature space exploration and the robustness of classical
regression models to forecast temperature variations and optimize pulverized
coal injection values. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in
prediction accuracy over 25 percent and our solution improved temperature
stability to +-7.6 degrees of target range from the earlier variance of +-50
degrees, highlighting the potential of hybrid quantum machine learning models
in industrial steel production applications.

Abstract: Benchmarks that concisely summarize the performance of many-qubit quantum
computers are essential for measuring progress towards the goal of useful
quantum computation. In this work, we present a benchmarking framework that is
based on quantifying how a quantum computer's performance on quantum circuits
varies as a function of features of those circuits, such as circuit depth,
width, two-qubit gate density, problem input size, or algorithmic depth. Our
featuremetric benchmarking framework generalizes volumetric benchmarking -- a
widely-used methodology that quantifies performance versus circuit width and
depth -- and we show that it enables richer and more faithful models of quantum
computer performance. We demonstrate featuremetric benchmarking with example
benchmarks run on IBM Q and IonQ systems of up to 27 qubits, and we show how to
produce performance summaries from the data using Gaussian process regression.
Our data analysis methods are also of interest in the special case of
volumetric benchmarking, as they enable the creation of intuitive
two-dimensional capability regions using data from few circuits.

Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic
perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error
probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this
paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein
the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a
desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of
binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error
probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and
Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely
characterize the query complexity of discriminating between two classical
channels. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of
binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel
discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric
R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends
on the negative logarithm of (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For
multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the
number of channels.

Conclusion: 主张动态适应取代静态优化，提高水库计算机的鲁棒性和神经计算理解。

Abstract: Reservoir computers (RCs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to
deep learning while also offering a framework for incorporating brain-inspired
computational principles. By using an internal neural network with random,
fixed connections$-$the 'reservoir'$-$and training only the output weights, RCs
simplify the training process but remain sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters that govern activation functions and network architecture.
Moreover, typical RC implementations overlook a critical aspect of neuronal
dynamics: the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals, which is
essential for robust brain function. We show that RCs characteristically
perform best in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, outperforming
excitation-dominated ones. To reduce the need for precise hyperparameter
tuning, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E/I balance
to achieve target neuronal firing rates, improving performance by up to 130% in
tasks like memory capacity and time series prediction compared with globally
tuned RCs. Incorporating brain-inspired heterogeneity in target neuronal firing
rates further reduces the need for fine-tuning hyperparameters and enables RCs
to excel across linear and non-linear tasks. These results support a shift from
static optimization to dynamic adaptation in reservoir design, demonstrating
how brain-inspired mechanisms improve RC performance and robustness while
deepening our understanding of neural computation.

Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, all existing methods that can generate
synthetic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for a specific
individual require detailed structural or volumetric information about the
individual's brain. However, such brain information is often scarce, expensive,
and difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose the first approach capable
of generating synthetic brain MRI segmentations -- specifically, 3D white
matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) segmentations --
for individuals using their easily obtainable and often readily available
demographic, interview, and cognitive test information. Our approach features a
novel deep generative model, CSegSynth, which outperforms existing prominent
generative models, including conditional variational autoencoder (C-VAE),
conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), and conditional latent
diffusion model (C-LDM). We demonstrate the high quality of our synthetic
segmentations through extensive evaluations. Also, in assessing the
effectiveness of the individual-specific generation, we achieve superior volume
prediction, with Pearson correlation coefficients reaching 0.80, 0.82, and 0.70
between the ground-truth WM, GM, and CSF volumes of test individuals and those
volumes predicted based on generated individual-specific segmentations,
respectively.
