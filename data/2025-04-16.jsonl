Unfortunately, an adversary can corrupt the battery terminal voltage\ndata as it passes from the local-BMS to the cloud-BMS through the communication\nnetwork, with the objective of under- or over-charging the battery. To ensure\naccurate terminal voltage data under such malicious sensor attacks, this paper\ninvestigates a Koopman-based secure terminal voltage estimation scheme using a\ntwo-stage error-compensated self-learning feedback. During the first stage of\nerror correction, the potential Koopman prediction error is estimated to\ncompensate for the error accumulation due to the linear approximation of\nKoopman operator. The second stage of error compensation aims to recover the\nerror amassing from the higher-order dynamics of the Lithium-ion batteries\nmissed by the self-learning strategy. Specifically, we have proposed two\ndifferent methods for this second stage error compensation.

Among these, X social network (formerly Twitter) stands as a\njuggernaut, boasting approximately 420 million active users. Extracting users'\nemotional and mental states from their expressed opinions on social media has\nbecome a common pursuit. While past methodologies predominantly focused on the\ntextual content of messages to analyze user sentiment, the interactive nature\nof these platforms suggests a deeper complexity. This study employs hybrid\nmethodologies, integrating textual analysis, profile examination, follower\nanalysis, and emotion dissemination patterns. Initially, user interactions are\nleveraged to refine emotion classification within messages, encompassing\nexchanges where users respond to each other. Introducing the concept of a\ncommunication tree, a model is extracted to map these interactions.\nSubsequently, users' bios and interests from this tree are juxtaposed with\nmessage text to enrich analysis. Finally, influential figures are identified\namong users' followers in the communication tree, categorized into different\ntopics to gauge interests. The study highlights that traditional sentiment\nanalysis methodologies, focusing solely on textual content, are inadequate in\ndiscerning sentiment towards significant events, notably the presidential\nelection. Comparative analysis with conventional methods reveals a substantial\nimprovement in accuracy with the incorporation of emotion distribution patterns\nand user profiles. The proposed approach yields a 12% increase in accuracy with\nemotion distribution patterns and a 15% increase when considering user\nprofiles, underscoring its efficacy in capturing nuanced sentiment dynamics."}

LEMUR is primarily designed to\nenable fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) for AutoML tasks, providing\na rich source of structured model representations and associated performance\ndata. Leveraging Python and PyTorch, LEMUR enables seamless extension to new\ndatasets and models while maintaining consistency. It integrates an\nOptuna-powered framework for evaluation, hyperparameter optimization,\nstatistical analysis, and graphical insights. LEMUR provides an extension that\nenables models to run efficiently on edge devices, facilitating deployment in\nresource-constrained environments. Providing tools for model evaluation,\npreprocessing, and database management, LEMUR supports researchers and\npractitioners in developing, testing, and analyzing neural networks.\nAdditionally, it offers an API that delivers comprehensive information about\nneural network models and their complete performance statistics with a single\nrequest, which can be used in experiments with code-generating large language\nmodels. The LEMUR will be released as an open source project under the MIT\nlicense upon acceptance of the paper."}

In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm regularizing\nunsupervised RL towards imitating trajectories from unlabeled behavior\ndatasets. The key technical novelty of our method, called Forward-Backward\nRepresentations with Conditional-Policy Regularization, is to train\nforward-backward representations to embed the unlabeled trajectories to the\nsame latent space used to represent states, rewards, and policies, and use a\nlatent-conditional discriminator to encourage policies to ``cover'' the states\nin the unlabeled behavior dataset. As a result, we can learn policies that are\nwell aligned with the behaviors in the dataset, while retaining zero-shot\ngeneralization capabilities for reward-based and imitation tasks. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach in a challenging humanoid\ncontrol problem: leveraging observation-only motion capture datasets, we train\nMeta Motivo, the first humanoid behavioral foundation model that can be\nprompted to solve a variety of whole-body tasks, including motion tracking,\ngoal reaching, and reward optimization.

The empirical results\npresented suggest that layers deeper within Forward-Forward networks experience\na delay in accuracy improvement relative to shallower layers and that shallower\nlayer accuracy is strongly correlated with overall model accuracy."}

Recently, Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool to optimize resource allocation\npolicies in business processes. In the DRL framework, an agent learns a policy\nthrough interaction with the environment, guided solely by reward signals that\nindicate the quality of its decisions. However, existing algorithms are not\nsuitable for dynamic environments such as business processes. Furthermore,\nexisting DRL-based methods rely on engineered reward functions that approximate\nthe desired objective, but a misalignment between reward and objective can lead\nto undesired decisions or suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we\npropose a rollout-based DRL algorithm and a reward function to optimize the\nobjective directly. Our algorithm iteratively improves the policy by evaluating\nexecution trajectories following different actions. Our reward function\ndirectly decomposes the objective function of minimizing the mean cycle time.\nMaximizing our reward function guarantees that the objective function is\nminimized without requiring extensive reward engineering.

To achieve this goal, we use two recently developed\ndynamical indices: the instantaneous dimension ($d$), and the inverse\npersistence ($\\theta$). Our results indicate that larger forecast errors --\ne.g., higher MSE -- tend to occur in states with higher $d$ (higher complexity)\nand higher $\\theta$ (lower persistence). To further assess dynamical\nconsistency, we propose error metrics based on the dynamical indices that\nmeasure the discrepancy of the forecasted $d$ and $\\theta$ versus their correct\nvalues. Leveraging these dynamical indices-based metrics, we analyze direct and\nrecursive forecasting strategies for three canonical datasets -- Lorenz,\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and Kolmogorov flow -- as well as a real-world\nweather forecasting task.

We find that visual information plays a key\nrole in labeling sexist content for both humans and models. Models effectively\ndetect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with implicit cases, such as\nstereotypes, instances where annotators also show low agreement. This\nhighlights the inherent difficulty of the task, as identifying implicit sexism\ndepends on the social and cultural context."}

DeepSelective combines data\ncompression techniques with an innovative feature selection approach,\nintegrating custom-designed modules that work together to improve both accuracy\nand interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepSelective not only\nenhances predictive accuracy but also significantly improves interpretability,\nmaking it a valuable tool for clinical decision-making.

Masculine\ndefaults involve three key parts: (i) the cultural context, (ii) the masculine\ncharacteristics or behaviors, and (iii) the reward for, or simply acceptance\nof, those masculine characteristics or behaviors. In this work, we study\ndiscourse-based masculine defaults, and propose a twofold framework for (i) the\nlarge-scale discovery and analysis of gendered discourse words in spoken\ncontent via our Gendered Discourse Correlation Framework (GDCF); and (ii) the\nmeasurement of the gender bias associated with these gendered discourse words\nin LLMs via our Discourse Word-Embedding Association Test (D-WEAT). We focus\nour study on podcasts, a popular and growing form of social media, analyzing\n15,117 podcast episodes. We analyze correlations between gender and discourse\nwords -- discovered via LDA and BERTopic -- to automatically form gendered\ndiscourse word lists. We then study the prevalence of these gendered discourse\nwords in domain-specific contexts, and find that gendered discourse-based\nmasculine defaults exist in the domains of business, technology/politics, and\nvideo games. Next, we study the representation of these gendered discourse\nwords from a state-of-the-art LLM embedding model from OpenAI, and find that\nthe masculine discourse words have a more stable and robust representation than\nthe feminine discourse words, which may result in better system performance on\ndownstream tasks for men. Hence, men are rewarded for their discourse patterns\nwith better system performance by one of the state-of-the-art language models\n-- and this embedding disparity is a representational harm and a masculine\ndefault."}

(ii) However, the\nperformance gaps across models are relatively small, indicating that color\nunderstanding has been largely neglected by existing VLMs. (iii) CoT reasoning\nimproves color understanding accuracies and robustness, though they are\nvision-centric tasks. (iv) Color clues are indeed leveraged by VLMs on\nColorBench but they can also mislead models in some tasks. These findings\nhighlight the critical limitations of current VLMs and underscore the need to\nenhance color comprehension. Our ColorBenchcan serve as a foundational tool for\nadvancing the study of human-level color understanding of multimodal AI."}

Most well-known models commonly employ\nrepresentation learning to map users and items into a unified embedding space\nfor matching assessment.

Two primary\nlimitations are their proneness to overfitting and failure to incorporate\nepistemic uncertainty in predictions. To address these problems, we propose a\nnovel Bayesian Deep Ensemble Collaborative Filtering method named BDECF.

Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual\nscenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural\ninformation, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish\nknown nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in\ntransductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge,\nwe propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN).

Such universality\ntypically requires joint training across multi-domain datasets to ensure\neffective generalization. However, monocular 3D object detection presents\nunique challenges in multi-domain training due to the scarcity of datasets\nannotated with accurate 3D ground-truth labels, especially beyond typical\nroad-based autonomous driving contexts. To address this challenge, we introduce\na novel weakly supervised framework leveraging pseudo-labels. Current\npretrained models often struggle to accurately detect pedestrians in non-road\nenvironments due to inherent dataset biases. Unlike generalized image-based 2D\nobject detection models, achieving similar generalization in monocular 3D\ndetection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose GATE3D, a novel\nframework designed specifically for generalized monocular 3D object detection\nvia weak supervision. GATE3D effectively bridges domain gaps by employing\nconsistency losses between 2D and 3D predictions. Remarkably, our model\nachieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark as well as on an\nindoor-office dataset collected by us to evaluate the generalization\ncapabilities of our framework.

To establish this\nresult, we first demonstrate the strictly positive definiteness of the NTKs for\nmulti-layer FCNs and ResNets. Then, we prove that during training, % with the\ncross-entropy loss, the neural network parameters diverge if the smallest\neigenvalue of the empirical NTK matrix (Gram matrix) with respect to training\nsamples is bounded below by a positive constant. This behavior contrasts\nsharply with the lazy training regime commonly observed in regression problems.\nConsequently, using a proof by contradiction, we show that the empirical NTK\ndoes not uniformly converge to the NTK across all times on the training samples\nas the network width increases. We validate our theoretical results through\nexperiments on both synthetic data and the MNIST classification task. This\nfinding implies that NTK theory is not applicable in this context, with\nsignificant theoretical implications for understanding neural networks in\nclassification problems."}

One of the root causes for these limitations is that the\ndistributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different\nprediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and\ndimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge\ndistillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher\nand the student models for KD.

To overcome the\ncomputational burden of multi-view video generation, we randomly subsample the\nduration and camera views used during training and show that the model is able\nto gracefully generalize to generating more frames during inference.

This challenge is\nparticularly acute in medical applications in developing countries with limited\ncomputational resources. Combining modern and classical techniques offers a\npath to maintaining competitive performance while enabling practical\napplications. Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) methodology empowers\nexperts to design convolutional encoders through user-drawn markers, with\nfilters learned directly from these annotations. Recent findings demonstrate\nthat coupling a FLIM encoder with an adaptive decoder creates a flyweight\nnetwork suitable for SOD, requiring significantly fewer parameters than\nlightweight models and eliminating the need for backpropagation. Cellular\nAutomata (CA) methods have proven successful in data-scarce scenarios but\nrequire proper initialization -- typically through user input, priors, or\nrandomness. We propose a practical intersection of these approaches: using FLIM\nnetworks to initialize CA states with expert knowledge without requiring user\ninteraction for each image. By decoding features from each level of a FLIM\nnetwork, we can initialize multiple CAs simultaneously, creating a multi-level\nframework. Our method leverages the hierarchical knowledge encoded across\ndifferent network layers, merging multiple saliency maps into a high-quality\nfinal output that functions as a CA ensemble.

However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework\nexhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different\noutput spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the\nstudent model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different\nvocabularies. One of the root causes for these limitations is that the\ndistributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different\nprediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and\ndimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge\ndistillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher\nand the student models for KD. Specifically, we first introduce two projectors\nwith ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the\nstudent/teacher representation spaces. After this, the hidden states from\ndifferent models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the\ndistributions. Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm\nto align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences. Based on the\nabove, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both\noff-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their\nvocabularies.
