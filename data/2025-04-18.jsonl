We divide visits into 4 groups based on the patient's treatment regimen\nbefore the visit, and further divide them into subgroups based on the\nrecommended treatment during the visit. Since each subgroup has observational\ndata, which has confounding bias (sicker patients are prescribed more\naggressive treatments), we used machine learning and optimization to remove\nsome datapoints so that the remaining data resembles a randomized trial. On\neach subgroup, we train AI-backed tree-based models to prescribe treatment\nchanges. Once we train these tree models, we manually combine the models for\nevery group to create an end-to-end prescription pipeline for all patients in\nthat group. In this process, we prioritize stepping up to a more aggressive\ntreatment before considering less aggressive options. We tested this pipeline\non unseen data from BMC, and an external dataset from Hartford healthcare (type\n2 diabetes patient visits from January 2020 to May 2024).\n  Results: The median HbA1c reduction achieved by our pipelines is 0.26% more\nthan what the doctors achieved on the unseen BMC patients. For the Hartford\ncohort, our pipelines were better by 0.13%.\n  Conclusions: This precise, interpretable, and efficient AI-backed approach to\ntreatment progression in type 2 diabetes is predicted to outperform the current\npractice and can be deployed to improve patient outcomes."}

However, traditional power planning\nhas yet to integrate local economic impact directly into capacity expansion to\nguide optimal siting decisions. Moreover, existing economic assessments tend to\nemphasize local benefits while overlooking the opportunity costs of converting\nproductive farmland for solar development. This study addresses these gaps by\nendogenously incorporating local economic metrics into a power system planning\nmodel to evaluate how economic impacts influence solar siting, accounting for\nthe cost of lost agricultural output. We analyze all counties within the Great\nLakes region, constructing localized supply and marginal benefit curves that\nare embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at\nminimizing system costs and maximizing community economic benefits. Our\nfindings show that counties with larger economies and lower farmland\nproductivity deliver the highest local economic benefit per megawatt (MW) of\ninstalled solar capacity. In Ohio, for example, large counties generate up to\n$34,500 per MW, driven in part by high property tax revenues, while smaller\ncounties yield 31% less. Accounting for the opportunity cost of displaced\nagricultural output reduces local benefits by up to 16%, depending on farmland\nquality. A scenario prioritizing solar investment in counties with higher\neconomic returns increases total economic benefits by $1 billion (or 11%) by\n2040, with solar investment shifting away from Michigan and Wisconsin (down by\n39%) toward Ohio and Indiana (up by 75%), with only a marginal increase of 0.5%\nin system-wide costs.

However, obtaining an echocardiogram requires an expert\nsonographer and a high-quality ultrasound imaging device, which are generally\nonly available in hospitals. Recently, AI-based navigation models and\nalgorithms have been used to aid novice sonographers in acquiring the\nstandardized cardiac views necessary to visualize potential disease\npathologies. These navigation systems typically rely on directional guidance to\npredict the necessary rotation of the ultrasound probe. This paper demonstrates\na novel AI navigation system that builds on a decision model for identifying\nthe inferior vena cava (IVC) of the heart. The decision model is trained\noffline using cardiac ultrasound videos and employs binary classification to\ndetermine whether the IVC is present in a given ultrasound video. The\nunderlying model integrates a novel localization algorithm that leverages the\nlearned feature representations to annotate the spatial location of the IVC in\nreal-time. Our model demonstrates strong localization performance on\ntraditional high-quality hospital ultrasound videos, as well as impressive\nzero-shot performance on lower-quality ultrasound videos from a more affordable\nButterfly iQ handheld ultrasound machine. This capability facilitates the\nexpansion of ultrasound diagnostics beyond hospital settings. Currently, the\nguidance system is undergoing clinical trials and is available on the Butterfly\niQ app."}

In this work, we show that, in at least some cases,\nLLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly,\nand we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this\ninformation to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting\nthe language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic\nimprovements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability\ntechniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to\nwhich that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is\npossible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate\nwith the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of\nthese layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high\nperformance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information\nrequired to produce a correct response is contained within the representations\nof the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning\nis significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error\nafter finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior.

Our approach divides the dataset into disjoint subsets, computes the\nposterior for each subset, and applies VB approximation independently to these\nposteriors. The resulting variational posteriors with respect to the subsets\nare then aggregated using the geometric median of probability measures,\ncomputed with respect to the Wasserstein distance. This novel aggregation\nmethod yields the Variational Median Posterior (VM-Posterior) distribution. We\nrigorously demonstrate that the VM-Posterior preserves contraction properties\nakin to those of the true posterior, while accounting for approximation errors\nor the variational gap inherent in VB methods. We also provide provable\nrobustness guarantee of the VM-Posterior. Furthermore, we establish a\nvariational Bernstein-von Mises theorem for both multivariate Gaussian\ndistributions with general covariance structures and the mean-field variational\nfamily.

Furthermore, to\nenhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module\nthat fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame\nevents and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable\nalignment process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets. Notably, on real data, our method is +2.59 dB more accurate and\n7.28$\\times$ faster than the recent best BVSR baseline FMA-Net. Code:\nhttps://github.com/DachunKai/Ev-DeblurVSR."}

The challenge comprises two tracks:\n(i) Efficient Video Quality Assessment (KVQ), and (ii) Diffusion-based Image\nSuper-Resolution (KwaiSR). Track 1 aims to advance the development of\nlightweight and efficient video quality assessment (VQA) models, with an\nemphasis on eliminating reliance on model ensembles, redundant weights, and\nother computationally expensive components in the previous IQA/VQA\ncompetitions. Track 2 introduces a new short-form UGC dataset tailored for\nsingle image super-resolution, i.e., the KwaiSR dataset. It consists of 1,800\nsynthetically generated S-UGC image pairs and 1,900 real-world S-UGC images,\nwhich are split into training, validation, and test sets using a ratio of\n8:1:1. The primary objective of the challenge is to drive research that\nbenefits the user experience of short-form UGC platforms such as Kwai and\nTikTok. This challenge attracted 266 participants and received 18 valid final\nsubmissions with corresponding fact sheets, significantly contributing to the\nprogress of short-form UGC VQA and image superresolution. The project is\npublicly available at https://github.com/lixinustc/KVQE-\nChallengeCVPR-NTIRE2025."}

Imposing such constraints can be naturally\nframed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting\ndistribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution\n-- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for\ncontrolled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC\nframework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific\nconstraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational\nresources in light of new information during the course of generation. By\ncomparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains\n-- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and\nmolecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach\nallows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger,\nas well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic\nperspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better\napproximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework\nof Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic\nprogramming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a\nbroad variety of controlled generation problems."}

Additionally, we introduce a suite of\nmetrics to assess various aspects of editing performance, along with a\nVLM-based auto-evaluation pipeline that supports large-scale assessments. Our\nbenchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly\nunderperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the\nperformance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased\ninstructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key\nelements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality;\n3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed\nin a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple\nmetrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for\nboth direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe\na ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model\ntraining, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly\nsynthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon\nthat intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs."}

In pursuit of meaningful and lasting evaluation standards, we\npropose MIB, a benchmark with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models.\nMIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal\npathways or specific causal variables in neural language models. The circuit\nlocalization track compares methods that locate the model components - and\nconnections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g.,\nattribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable\nlocalization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g.,\nsparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and locate\nmodel features for a causal variable relevant to the task. Using MIB, we find\nthat attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit\nlocalization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS\nmethod performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e.,\nstandard dimensions of hidden vectors.

Going beyond these objectives, we present a set of\nalternative attentional bias configurations along with their effective\napproximations to stabilize their training procedure. We then reinterpret\nforgetting mechanisms in modern deep learning architectures as a form of\nretention regularization, providing a novel set of forget gates for sequence\nmodels. Building upon these insights, we present Miras, a general framework to\ndesign deep learning architectures based on four choices of: (i) associative\nmemory architecture, (ii) attentional bias objective, (iii) retention gate, and\n(iv) memory learning algorithm. We present three novel sequence models-Moneta,\nYaad, and Memora-that go beyond the power of existing linear RNNs while\nmaintaining a fast parallelizable training process.
