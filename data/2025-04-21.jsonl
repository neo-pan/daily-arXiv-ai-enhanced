This paper proposes a\nre-planning strategy using a multilayer planning and control framework for\ncases where the robot's environment is partially known. A medial axis\ngraph-based planner defines a global path plan based on known obstacles where\neach edge in the graph corresponds to a unique corridor. A mixed-integer model\npredictive control (MPC) method detects if a terminal constraint derived from\nthe global plan is infeasible, subject to a non-convex description of the local\nenvironment. Infeasibility detection is used to trigger efficient global\nre-planning via medial axis graph edge deletion. The proposed re-planning\nstrategy is demonstrated experimentally."}

Many of the research efforts and policy\ndiscourse are centered around robust watermarking of AI outputs. While plenty\nof progress has been made, all watermarking and AI detection techniques face\nsevere limitations. In this position paper, we argue that we are adopting the\nwrong approach, and should instead focus on watermarking via cryptographic\nsignatures trustworthy content rather than AI generated ones. For audio-visual\ncontent, in particular, all real content is grounded in the physical world and\ncaptured via hardware sensors. This presents a unique opportunity to watermark\nat the hardware layer, and we lay out a socio-technical framework and draw\nparallels with HTTPS certification and Blu-Ray verification protocols. While\nacknowledging implementation challenges, we contend that hardware-based\nauthentication offers a more tractable path forward, particularly from a policy\nperspective. As generative models approach perceptual indistinguishability, the\nresearch community should be wary of being overly optimistic with AI\nwatermarking, and we argue that AI watermarking research efforts are better\nspent in the text and LLM space, which are ultimately not traceable to a\nphysical sensor."}

DL surpasses traditional\nmachine learning and human accuracy, making it a critical tool for identifying\ndiseases. Despite numerous reviews on DL in healthcare, a comprehensive\nanalysis of its role in cancer detection remains limited. Existing studies\nfocus on specific aspects, leaving gaps in understanding its broader impact.\nThis paper addresses these gaps by reviewing advanced DL techniques, including\ntransfer learning (TL), reinforcement learning (RL), federated learning (FL),\nTransformers, and large language models (LLMs). These approaches enhance\naccuracy, tackle data scarcity, and enable decentralized learning while\nmaintaining data privacy. TL adapts pre-trained models to new datasets,\nimproving performance with limited labeled data. RL optimizes diagnostic\npathways and treatment strategies, while FL fosters collaborative model\ndevelopment without sharing sensitive data. Transformers and LLMs,\ntraditionally used in natural language processing, are now applied to medical\ndata for improved interpretability.

To\nenable more automated validation of parser implementations against protocol\nstandards, we propose PARVAL, a multi-agent framework built on large language\nmodels (LLMs). PARVAL leverages the capabilities of LLMs to understand both\nnatural language and code.

We present\na comprehensive analysis comparing the two most common techniques for\nmitigating this spectral bias: Fourier feature encodings (FFE) and multigrid\nparametric encodings (MPE). FFEs are seen as the standard for low dimensional\nmappings, but MPEs often outperform them and learn representations with higher\nresolution and finer detail. FFE's roots in the Fourier transform, make it\nsusceptible to aliasing if pushed too far, while MPEs, which use a learned grid\nstructure, have no such limitation. To understand the difference in\nperformance, we use the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to evaluate these encodings\nthrough the lens of an analogous kernel regression. By finding a lower bound on\nthe smallest eigenvalue of the NTK, we prove that MPEs improve a network's\nperformance through the structure of their grid and not their learnable\nembedding. This mechanism is fundamentally different from FFEs, which rely\nsolely on their embedding space to improve performance.

Introduction and background open this work before diving\ninto operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization\ntechniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for\nbreast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI\nand causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past\nand future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the\ncausality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature\nco-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable\npredictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that\nintegrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and\nprior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological\nvision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a\nconnectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall,\nour key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for\nmedical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and\nradiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak\ncausal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve\nperformance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical\ndomains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit\nmotifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward\nhuman-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and\nclinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy,\nand safe deployment."}

Recently, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have gained attention for code-related tasks, but their\npotential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make\ntwo major contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs,\nincluding GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against\ntraditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP\nscripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework,\ndesigned to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain.\nOur framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that\nisolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy\nthat captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted\nBehavioral Function Profiling (WBFP) that enhances in-context learning by\nprioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative\nfunction-level profiles. Our results show that larger LLMs achieve near-perfect\nprecision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite\ntrade-off. However, all models lag behind previous State-Of-The-Art (SOTA)\nmethods. With BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improved, with an average F1\nscore increase of 13.82%.
