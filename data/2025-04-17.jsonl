The text highlights a crucial distinction between the semantic content\nof a domain and the modalities of its graphic expression, illustrating this\napproach with concepts rooted in structural semiotics and linguistics\ntraditions.\n  2) Modeling and Conceptual Design: The article emphasizes the importance of\nsemantic modeling, often achieved through conceptual networks or graphs. These\ntools enable the structuring of knowledge within a domain by accounting for\nrelationships between concepts, contexts of use, and specific objectives.\nStockinger also highlights the constraints and challenges involved in creating\ndynamic and adaptable models, integrating elements such as thesauri or\ninteroperable ontologies to facilitate the analysis and publication of complex\ncorpora.\n  3) Applications and Multimodal Visualization: The text concludes by examining\nthe practical application of these models in work environments like OKAPI,\ndeveloped to analyze, publish, and reuse audiovisual data. It also discusses\ninnovative approaches such as visual storytelling and document reengineering,\nwhich involve transforming existing content into new resources tailored to\nvarious contexts.

This paper addresses the control design problem for a class of\nnonlinear systems under both actuator saturation and output constraints. First,\na smooth asymmetric saturation model (a more generic representative of\npractical scenarios) is proposed to model actuator saturation, which ensures\nthat the control inputs always remain confined within a predefined set to\nensure safety. Based on the proposed model, we develop a nonlinear control\nframework that guarantees output tracking while ensuring that system output\nremains confined to the predefined set. Later, we integrate this design with\nthe constrained output tracking control problem, wherein we show that the\nsystem output tracks its desired trajectory by simultaneously satisfying input\nand output constraints. The global stabilization of the tracking error is\nachieved in the presence of input constraints, while semi-global stabilization\nis achieved in the presence of both input and output constraints. Additionally,\nwe rigorously establish the boundedness of all closed-loop signals under the\nproposed design.

Next, for\nindividual spatiotemporal feature attention, we change the attention method to\nlocal temporal attention and ROI-rank based masking. For the temporal features\nof fMRI, the local temporal attention enables to learn local BOLD signal\nfeatures with only simple window masking.

Attackers exploit partially exposed user profiles in\nrecommendation models, such as user embeddings, to infer private attributes of\ntarget users, such as gender and political views. The goal of defenders is to\nmitigate the effectiveness of these attacks while maintaining recommendation\nperformance. Most existing defense methods, such as differential privacy and\nattribute unlearning, focus on post-training settings, which limits their\ncapability of utilizing training data to preserve recommendation performance.\nAlthough adversarial training extends defenses to in-training settings, it\noften struggles with convergence due to unstable training processes. In this\npaper, we propose RAID, an in-training defense method against attribute\ninference attacks in recommender systems. In addition to the recommendation\nobjective, we define a defensive objective to ensure that the distribution of\nprotected attributes becomes independent of class labels, making users\nindistinguishable from attribute inference attacks. Specifically, this\ndefensive objective aims to solve a constrained Wasserstein barycenter problem\nto identify the centroid distribution that makes the attribute\nindistinguishable while complying with recommendation performance constraints.\nTo optimize our proposed objective, we use optimal transport to align users\nwith the centroid distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four\nreal-world datasets to evaluate RAID. The experimental results validate the\neffectiveness of RAID and demonstrate its significant superiority over existing\nmethods in multiple aspects."}

The core idea of Saga is\nto first pre-train a backbone feature extraction model, utilizing the rich\nsemantic information of different levels embedded in the massive unlabelled IMU\ndata. Meanwhile, for a specific downstream user perception application,\nBayesian Optimization is employed to determine the optimal weights for\npre-training tasks involving different semantic levels. We implement Saga on\nfive typical mobile phones and evaluate Saga on three typical tasks on three\nIMU datasets. Results show that when only using about 100 training samples per\nclass, Saga can achieve over 90% accuracy of the full-fledged model trained on\nover ten thousands training samples with no additional system overhead."}

Our approach\nemploys a multi-level framework (MULTI-LF) featuring two machine learning\nmodels: a lightweight Model 1 (M1) trained on a selective, critical packet\ndataset for fast and efficient initial detection, and a more complex, highly\naccurate Model 2 (M2) trained on extensive data. When M1 exhibits low\nconfidence in its predictions, the decision is escalated to M2 for verification\nand potential fine-tuning of M1 using insights from M2. If both models\ndemonstrate low confidence, the system flags the incident for human\nintervention, facilitating model updates with human-verified categories to\nenhance adaptability to unseen attack patterns. We validate the MULTI-LF\nthrough real-world simulations, demonstrating superior classification accuracy\nof 0.999 and low prediction latency of 0.866 seconds compared to established\nbaselines. Furthermore, we evaluate performance in terms of memory usage (3.632\nMB) and CPU utilization (10.05%) in real-time scenarios."}

To address this gap, we propose a novel\nframework, DeftRec, which incorporates \\textbf{de}noising di\\textbf{f}fusion\nmodels to enable LLM-based RecSys to seamlessly support continuous\n\\textbf{t}oken as input and target. First, we introduce a robust tokenizer with\na masking operation and an additive K-way architecture to index users and\nitems, capturing their complex collaborative relationships into continuous\ntokens. Crucially, we develop a denoising diffusion model to process user\npreferences within continuous domains by conditioning on reasoning content from\npre-trained large language model. During the denoising process, we reformulate\nthe objective to include negative interactions, building a comprehensive\nunderstanding of user preferences for effective and accurate recommendation\ngeneration. Finally, given a continuous token as output, recommendations can be\neasily generated through score-based retrieval. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing that DeftRec\nsurpasses competitive benchmarks, including both traditional and emerging\nLLM-based RecSys."}

A simple\napproach to computing confidence scores is to extract, alongside each\nprediction, the corresponding prediction probabilities and use them as\nindicators of confidence.

However, benchmarks and tooling to comprehensively evaluate LLMs for\nHLS design tasks remain scarce.\n  To address this, we introduce HLS-Eval, the first complete benchmark and\nevaluation framework for LLM-driven HLS design. HLS-Eval targets two core\ntasks: (1) generating HLS code from natural language descriptions, and (2)\nperforming HLS-specific code edits to optimize performance and hardware\nefficiency. The benchmark includes 94 unique designs drawn from standard HLS\nbenchmarks and novel sources. Each case is prepared via a semi-automated flow\nthat produces a natural language description and a paired testbench for\nC-simulation and synthesis validation, ensuring each task is \"LLM-ready.\"\n  Beyond the benchmark, HLS-Eval offers a modular Python framework for\nautomated, parallel evaluation of both local and hosted LLMs. It includes a\nparallel evaluation engine, direct HLS tool integration, and abstractions for\nto support different LLM interaction paradigms, enabling rapid prototyping of\nnew benchmarks, tasks, and LLM methods.\n  We demonstrate HLS-Eval through baseline evaluations of open-source LLMs on\nVitis HLS, measuring outputs across four key metrics - parseability,\ncompilability, runnability, and synthesizability - reflecting the iterative HLS\ndesign cycle. We also report pass@k metrics, establishing clear baselines and\nreusable infrastructure for the broader LLM-for-hardware community.\n  All benchmarks, framework code, and results are open-sourced at\nhttps://github.com/stefanpie/hls-eval."}
