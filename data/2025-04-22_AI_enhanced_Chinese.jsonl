We extend the PROM-ANN\narchitecture by complementing snapshot-based training with a FEM-based,\ndiscrete physics-informed residual loss, bridging the gap between traditional\nprojection-based ROMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Unlike\nconventional PINNs that rely on analytical PDEs, our approach leverages FEM\nresiduals to guide the learning of the ROM approximation manifold. Key\ncontributions include: (1) a parameter-agnostic, discrete residual loss\napplicable to non-linear problems, (2) an architectural modification to\nPROM-ANN improving accuracy for fast-decaying singular values, and (3) an\nempirical study on the proposed physics informed training process for ROMs.\n  The method is demonstrated on a non-linear hyperelasticity problem,\nsimulating a rubber cantilever under multi-axial loads. The main accomplishment\nin regards to the proposed residual-based loss is its applicability on\nnon-linear problems by interfacing with FEM software while maintaining\nreasonable training times. The modified PROM-ANN outperforms POD by orders of\nmagnitude in snapshot reconstruction accuracy, while the original formulation\nis not able to learn a proper mapping for this use-case. Finally, the\napplication of physics informed training in ANN-PROM modestly narrows the gap\nbetween data reconstruction and ROM accuracy, however it highlights the\nuntapped potential of the proposed residual-driven optimization for future ROM\ndevelopment. This work underscores the critical role of FEM residuals in ROM\nconstruction and calls for further exploration on architectures beyond\nPROM-ANN.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u6295\u5f71-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7FEM\u6b8b\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u6865\u63a5\u4f20\u7edfROM\u548cPINNs\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f25\u5408\u4f20\u7edfROM\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(PINNs)\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8ROM\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55PROM-ANN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u57fa\u4e8eFEM\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6b8b\u5dee\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8d85\u5f39\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86PROM-ANN\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85POD\u5728\u5feb\u8870\u51cf\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7f29\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784\u4e0eROM\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03FEM\u6b8b\u5dee\u5728ROM\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u8d85\u8d8aPROM-ANN\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Quantization methods compress\ntheir size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized\nvalues of lower precision. Post-training quantization reduces model size\nefficiently at the cost of decreased accuracy, while quantization-aware\ntraining better preserves accuracy but is resource-intensive. Among existing\npost-training quantization algorithms, the ApiQ method achieves superior\naccuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two\nideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level.\nFirst, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques\nwith ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the\nbaseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads\nto two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is\ngained through full retraining may not be feasible through partial training.\n(2) This gain seems to depend on using a large and diverse dataset in\nquantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the\ntwo insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon\nApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. It\nrelies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the\nmost impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on benchmark\nlanguage models from the LLaMA family show that our proposed approach boosts\naccuracy and tightens the gap between the quantized model and the\nfull-precision model, with minimal overhead.

These results provide valuable insights into\neffective data organization strategies for RLVR in specialized domains and\nhighlight the importance of thoughtful data selection in achieving optimal\nperformance.

However, most degradation investigations focus mainly on\nestimating the state of charge (SOC), which fails to accurately interpret the\ncells' internal degradation mechanisms. Differential capacity analysis (DCA)\nfocuses on the rate of change of cell voltage about the change in cell\ncapacity, under various charge/discharge rates. This paper developed a battery\ncell degradation testing model that used two types of lithium-ions (Li-ion)\nbattery cells, namely lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxides (LiNiCoAlO2) and\nlithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), to evaluate internal degradation during\nloading conditions. The proposed battery degradation model contains distinct\ncharge rates (DCR) of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 1.5C, as well as discharge rates\n(DDR) of 0.5C, 0.9C, 1.3C, and 1.6C to analyze the internal health and\nperformance of battery cells during slow, moderate, and fast loading\nconditions. Besides, this research proposed a model that incorporates the\nExtended Kalman Filter (EKF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to validate experimental data. The proposed\nmodel yields excellent modelling results based on mean squared error (MSE), and\nroot mean squared error (RMSE), with errors of less than 0.001% at DCR and DDR.\nThe peak identification technique (PIM) has been utilized to investigate\nbattery health based on the number of peaks, peak position, peak height, peak\narea, and peak width. At last, the PIM method has discovered that the cell aged\ngradually under normal loading rates but deteriorated rapidly under fast\nloading conditions.

Bloom's Taxonomy provides a structured\nframework for categorizing educational objectives into hierarchical cognitive\nlevels. Our research investigates whether incorporating this taxonomy can\nimprove the alignment of AI-generated questions with specific cognitive\nobjectives. We developed a dataset of 3691 questions categorized according to\nBloom's levels and employed various classification models-Multinomial Logistic\nRegression, Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (SVC), and a\nTransformer-based model (DistilBERT)-to evaluate their effectiveness in\ncategorizing questions. Our results indicate that higher Bloom's levels\ngenerally correlate with increased question length, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level\n(FKGL), and Lexical Density (LD), reflecting the increased complexity of higher\ncognitive demands. Multinomial Logistic Regression showed varying accuracy\nacross Bloom's levels, performing best for \"Knowledge\" and less accurately for\nhigher-order levels. Merging higher-level categories improved accuracy for\ncomplex cognitive tasks. Naive Bayes and Linear SVC also demonstrated effective\nclassification for lower levels but struggled with higher-order tasks.\nDistilBERT achieved the highest performance, significantly improving\nclassification of both lower and higher-order cognitive levels, achieving an\noverall validation accuracy of 91%.

Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with\nencouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed\nreasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently\nrobust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing\nagents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit\nreasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and\nerror recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from\nreactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate\nthis transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed\nthrough our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training\napproach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to\nDeliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on\nestablishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to\ntransfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to\nMLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to\nintegrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action\ngeneration. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic\nreasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage\nintroduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for\ngenerating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario\nConstruction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from\nidentified prone-to-error steps.

There have been extensive\nsuccessful works in this area. However, these approaches focus only on\nmodelling the flow transition and ignore the flow generation process, which\nmanifests itself in two ways: (i) The models are based on Markovian\nassumptions, ignoring the multi-periodicity of the flow generation in nodes.\n(ii) The same structure is designed to encode both the transition and\ngeneration processes, ignoring the differences between them. To address these\nproblems, we propose an Effective Multi-Branch Similarity Transformer for\nTraffic Flow Prediction, namely EMBSFormer. Through data analysis, we find that\nthe factors affecting traffic flow include node-level traffic generation and\ngraph-level traffic transition, which describe the multi-periodicity and\ninteraction pattern of nodes, respectively. Specifically, to capture traffic\ngeneration patterns, we propose a similarity analysis module that supports\nmulti-branch encoding to dynamically expand significant cycles. For traffic\ntransition, we employ a temporal and spatial self-attention mechanism to\nmaintain global node interactions, and use GNN and time conv to model local\nnode interactions, respectively.

The\nprimary difficulty in addressing this problem lies in the vast array of\npossible swapping orders for large paths and the complexity of the expected\nthroughput, which depends on the attributes of each node and edge along the\npath, as well as the order of swapping. To cope with these issues, we first\npropose simple approximations in estimating the swapping outcome between two\nentanglement distributions that can run in constant time, thereby providing an\nefficient approach for evaluating and comparing different swapping orders,\nallowing us to solve the problem exactly for small paths. Second, as the number\nof possible orders grows exponentially with the number of repeaters in the\npath, we develop an efficient heuristic based on the greedy selection of nodes\nto sequentially perform swaps according to their swapping scores, defined as\nthe expected number of entanglements resulting from their swaps. The scores are\nlocal but dynamic in the sense that they depend not just on the entanglement\ndistributions available on the path but also on prior swapping decisions.\nFinally, we illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model\nand approach through extensive experimentation conducted using a general\nquantum network simulator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u4e2d\u7ee7\u5668\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u627e\u5230\u5f02\u6784\u91cf\u5b50\u4e2d\u7ee7\u5668\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u4f20\u9012\u7387\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ea4\u6362\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5e38\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u6362\u5206\u6570\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8f83\u5927\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u4ea4\u6362\u987a\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Range anxiety and challenges\nassociated with charging EVs are among the key issues that reduce the adoption\nrate of EVs and, in turn, limit their system-level impacts. A promising\nsolution to address these challenges is the introduction of charging while\ndriving (CWD) lanes. Although technological advancements have made it possible\nto charge vehicles wirelessly while driving, introducing such lanes to the\ntraffic stream can potentially disturb traffic flow and result in new\ncongestion patterns. This study puts forward a framework to investigate the\neffects of CWD lanes on traffic flow, considering %autonomy, speed\nharmonization, and environmental factors for different market penetration rates\n(MPRs) of personal and commercial EVs. Different policies have been\ninvestigated to suggest the best design for CWD lanes. Results indicate that\nintroducing CWD lanes can decrease overall traffic throughput and increase\ncongestion due to additional lane-changing maneuvers by electric vehicles\naiming to utilize the CWD lane. Although higher MPRs of EVs help stabilize\ntraffic flow and reduce the number of shockwaves, speed disruption tends to\nincrease in the CWD lane and propagate to adjacent lanes. Emission analyses\nshow significant reductions (up to 63\\%) in pollution levels with increasing\nMPRs of personal and commercial EVs.

An Empirical Study of LLM Reasoning Ability Under Output Length Constraint", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent work has demonstrated the remarkable potential of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) in test-time scaling. By making the models think before\nanswering, they are able to achieve much higher accuracy with extra inference\ncomputation. However, in many real-world scenarios, models are used under time\nconstraints, where an answer should be given to the user within a certain\noutput length. It is unclear whether and how the reasoning abilities of LLMs\nremain effective under such constraints. We take a first look at this problem\nby conducting an in-depth empirical study.

Applying this axiomatic definition, we compare and interpret three\nexamples -- Hebbian non-optimized neural networks (NNs),\nbackpropagation-optimized NNs, and biological reflexive systems -- in terms of\ntheir intelligence, structural properties, and biological plausibility.\nFurthermore, by extending our definition into a categorical framework, we\nintroduce two categories, \"Time Category\" and \"Intelligence Category,\" along\nwith the functorial relationships between them, demonstrating the potential to\nrepresent changes and mimicry relationships among intelligent systems\nabstractly. Additionally, since intelligence, as defined herein, functions\neffectively only when accompanied by temporal interactions, we introduce the\nconcept of \"activity\" and explore how activity-based conditions influence\nclassifications and interpretations of intelligence. Finally, we suggest that\nour definitional methodology is not limited to intelligence alone, but can be\nsimilarly applied to other concepts, such as consciousness and emotion,\nadvocating for their formal reinterpretation through the same procedural steps:\ndefining a universal representation, selecting naive definitions, and axiomatic\nformalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u667a\u529b\u7684\u516c\u7406\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u5176\u591a\u4e49\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u529b\u6982\u5ff5\u5929\u771f\u4e14\u591a\u4e49\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u5408\u8bba\u8868\u793a\u5b87\u5b99\uff0c\u516c\u7406\u5316\u6539\u9769\u5929\u771f\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83Hebbian\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u751f\u7269\u53cd\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u667a\u529b\u8303\u7574\u53ca\u6d3b\u52a8\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u667a\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8303\u7574\u548c\u51fd\u5b50\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u667a\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u610f\u8bc6\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u7b49\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u666e\u904d\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5929\u771f\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u516c\u7406\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3002"}}

We\nincorporate a model weight selection method to address the mode collapse\nproblem and generate load patterns with high diversity. We develop a holistic\nevaluation method to validate the effectiveness of RLP-GAN using real-world\ndata of 417 households. The results demonstrate that RLP-GAN outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in capturing temporal dependencies and generating load\npatterns with higher similarity to real data. Furthermore, we have publicly\nreleased the RLP-GAN generated synthetic dataset, which comprises one million\nsynthetic residential load pattern profiles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRLP-GAN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4f4f\u5b85\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4f\u5b85\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4f4f\u5b85\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u8131\u78b3\u4ee5\u53ca\u7535\u7f51\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "RLP-GAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f31\u76d1\u7763GAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5907\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u83b7\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528417\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5bb6\u5ead\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aRLP-GAN\u5728\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "RLP-GAN\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Even distilling an ensemble to a single student model or weight\naveraging methods first requires training of multiple teacher models and does\nnot fully leverage the inherent stochasticity for generating and distilling\ndiversity in DL models. These constraints are particularly prohibitive in\nresource-constrained or latency-sensitive applications such as wearable\ndevices. This paper proposes to train only one model and generate multiple\ndiverse teacher representations using distillation-time dropout. However,\ngenerating these representations stochastically leads to noisy representations\nthat are misaligned with the learned task. To overcome this problem, a novel\nstochastic self-distillation (SSD) training strategy is introduced for\nfiltering and weighting teacher representation to distill from task-relevant\nrepresentations only, using student-guided knowledge distillation (SGKD).

However, in real-world graphs with\nlong-tailed degree distributions, high-degree nodes dominate message passing,\ncausing a degree bias where low-degree nodes remain under-represented due to\ninadequate messages.

The effective exploration of\nthe output space is essential for the success of RL.

This study investigates the feasibility of\nleveraging language models for automated patient record linkage, focusing on\ntwo key tasks: blocking and matching. Materials and Methods: We utilized\nreal-world healthcare data from the Missouri Cancer Registry and Research\nCenter, linking patient records from two independent sources using\nprobabilistic linkage as a baseline. A transformer-based model, RoBERTa, was\nfine-tuned for blocking using sentence embeddings. For matching, several\nlanguage models were experimented under fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,\nassessing their performance against ground truth labels. Results: The\nfine-tuned blocking model achieved a 92% reduction in the number of candidate\npairs while maintaining near-perfect recall. In the matching task, fine-tuned\nMistral-7B achieved the best performance with only 6 incorrect predictions.\nAmong zero-shot models, Mistral-Small-24B performed best, with a total of 55\nincorrect predictions. Discussion: Fine-tuned language models achieved strong\nperformance in patient record blocking and matching with minimal errors.\nHowever, they remain less accurate and efficient than a hybrid rule-based and\nprobabilistic approach for blocking. Additionally, reasoning models like\nDeepSeek-R1 are impractical for large-scale record linkage due to high\ncomputational costs.

However, reward\nhacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement\nfine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward\nhacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement\nlearning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future\nrewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this,\nwe propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation\nof PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as\nthe minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward\nhacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more\nreasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that\nPRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable\nreasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps.\nIn contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even\nat the beginning!

However, in\nlong-context scenarios, existing pipeline parallelism methods fail to address\nthe substantial activation memory pressure, primarily due to the peak memory\nconsumption resulting from the accumulation of activations across multiple\nmicrobatches. Moreover, these approaches inevitably introduce considerable\npipeline bubbles, further hindering efficiency.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose SlimPipe, a novel approach to\nfine-grained pipeline parallelism that employs uniform sequence slicing coupled\nwith one-forward-one-backward (1F1B) schedule. It reduces the accumulated\nactivations from several microbatches to just one, which is split into several\nslices. Although the slices are evenly partitioned, the computation cost is not\nequal across slices due to causal attention. We develop a sophisticated\nworkload redistribution technique to address this load imbalance. SlimPipe\nachieves (1) near-zero memory overhead and (2) minimal pipeline bubbles\nsimultaneously. The effectiveness of SlimPipe has been proven by thorough\ntesting with diverse model architectures, context window sizes, and\nSlimPipe-specific configurations. For example, on the Llama 70B model, compared\nto state-of-the-art methods, SlimPipe significantly boosts the Model FLOPs\nUtilization (MFU) to up to $1.57\\times$ for a context length of 512K.

In this paper, we conduct a meta-analysis to explore how XAI\naffects human performance in classification tasks. Our results show an\nimprovement in task performance through XAI-based decision support, though\nexplanations themselves are not the decisive driver for this improvement. The\nanalysis reveals that the studies' risk of bias moderates the effect of\nexplanations in AI, while the explanation type appears to play only a\nnegligible role. Our findings contribute to the human computer interaction\nfield by enhancing the understanding of human-XAI collaboration in DSS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08XAI\uff09\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u89e3\u91ca\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u504f\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\u8d77\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u8f93\u51fa\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u63a8\u52a8XAI\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9XAI\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u5143\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8XAI\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "XAI\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u89e3\u91ca\u975e\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u504f\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u8282\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u7c7b\u578b\u4f5c\u7528\u5fae\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b-XAI\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u9886\u57df\u8d21\u732e\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002"}}

Synthetic values generated by\nimputation models often concern data stakeholders about computational\ncomplexity, data quality, and data-driven outcomes. This paper eliminates these\nconcerns by proposing no imputation incremental learning (NIIL) of tabular data\nwith varying missing value rates and types. The proposed method incrementally\nlearns partitions of overlapping feature sets while using attention masks to\nexclude missing values from attention scoring. The average classification\nperformance rank order across 15 diverse tabular data sets highlights the\nsuperiority of NIIL over 11 state-of-the-art learning methods with or without\nmissing value imputations.

While extant literature focuses on human reluctance to follow\nalgorithmic advice, we reverse the perspective by investigating how AI agents\nbased on large language models (LLMs) assess and integrate human input. Our\nwork addresses a pressing managerial constraint: firms barred from deploying\nLLMs directly due to privacy concerns can still leverage them as mediating\ntools (for instance, anonymized outputs or decision pipelines) to guide\nhigh-stakes choices like pricing or discounts without exposing proprietary\ndata. Through a controlled prediction task, we analyze how an LLM-based AI\nagent weights human versus algorithmic predictions. We find that the AI system\nsystematically discounts human advice, penalizing human errors more severely\nthan algorithmic errors--a bias exacerbated when the agent's identity (human vs\nAI) is disclosed and the human is positioned second. These results reveal a\ndisconnect between AI-generated trust metrics and the actual influence of human\njudgment, challenging assumptions about equitable human-AI collaboration. Our\nfindings offer three key contributions. First, we identify a reverse algorithm\naversion phenomenon, where AI agents undervalue human input despite comparable\nerror rates. Second, we demonstrate how disclosure and positional bias interact\nto amplify this effect, with implications for system design. Third, we provide\na framework for indirect LLM deployment that balances predictive power with\ndata privacy.

Recently, several research efforts have been made on merging\nthese large models into a single multi-task model, particularly with simple\narithmetic on parameters. Such merging methodology faces a central challenge:\ninterference between model parameters fine-tuned on different tasks. Few recent\nworks have focused on designing a new fine-tuning scheme that can lead to small\nparameter interference, however at the cost of the performance of each\ntask-specific fine-tuned model and thereby limiting that of a merged model.

Despite their importance,\nevaluating the quality of counterfactual explanations remains an open problem.\nTraditional quantitative metrics, such as sparsity or proximity, fail to fully\naccount for human preferences in explanations, while user studies are\ninsightful but not scalable. Moreover, relying only on a single overall\nsatisfaction rating does not lead to a nuanced understanding of why certain\nexplanations are effective or not. To address this, we analyze a dataset of\ncounterfactual explanations that were evaluated by 206 human participants, who\nrated not only overall satisfaction but also seven explanatory criteria:\nfeasibility, coherence, complexity, understandability, completeness, fairness,\nand trust. Modeling overall satisfaction as a function of these criteria, we\nfind that feasibility (the actionability of suggested changes) and trust (the\nbelief that the changes would lead to the desired outcome) consistently stand\nout as the strongest predictors of user satisfaction, though completeness also\nemerges as a meaningful contributor. Crucially, even excluding feasibility and\ntrust, other metrics explain 58% of the variance, highlighting the importance\nof additional explanatory qualities. Complexity appears independent, suggesting\nmore detailed explanations do not necessarily reduce satisfaction.

The framework is evaluated\nacross healthcare, finance, and software development, demonstrating its\npotential to enhance decision-making, regulatory compliance, and public trust.\nOur findings advance Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI), fostering AI\nsystems that are transparent, adaptable, and ethically aligned.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3AI\uff08HCAI\uff09\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08XAI\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8AI\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u81ea\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5448\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b\u4e09\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5177\u6709\u5185\u7f6e\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u7840AI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\uff082\uff09\u6839\u636e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b9a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89e3\u91ca\u5c42\uff0c\uff083\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08HCXAI\uff09\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

This well-defined narrow capability brings two nice benefits,\na clear criterion of success and the opportunity to collect a lot of examples.\nThe criteria not only reveal whether a machine has achieved a goal, but reveal\nhow the machine falls short of the goal. As a result, human designers can fix\nthe problems one after the other until the machine is deemed good enough for\nthe task. Furthermore, the large set of collected examples reduces the\ndifficulty of this problem-fixing process (by the central limit theorem).\n  Do the success in closed-world translate into broad open-world, where a\nmachine is required to perform any task that a human could possibly undertake\nwith fewer examples and less priori knowledge from human designers? No. Because\ncompetence in a specific task provides little insight in handling other tasks,\nthe valuable criteria for specific tasks become helpless when handling broader\nunseen tasks.

It is characterized by a small number of samples\nand an imbalanced class distribution, which leads to poor model performance.

Existing methods often rely on algorithmic heuristics\nwithout sufficiently analyzing the underlying data characteristics. We argue\nthat a detailed analysis from the data perspective is essential before\ndeveloping an appropriate solution. Therefore, this paper proposes a systematic\nanalytical framework for the S\\&I problem.

Recent advancements in\nLatent Bayesian Optimization (LBO) have shown promise by integrating generative\nmodels such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) to manage the complexity of\nhigh-dimensional and structured data spaces. However, existing LBO approaches\noften suffer from the value discrepancy problem, which arises from the\nreconstruction gap between input and latent spaces. This value discrepancy\nproblem propagates errors throughout the optimization process, leading to\nsuboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we propose a Normalizing Flow-based\nBayesian Optimization (NF-BO), which utilizes normalizing flow as a generative\nmodel to establish one-to-one encoding function from the input space to the\nlatent space, along with its left-inverse decoding function, eliminating the\nreconstruction gap. Specifically, we introduce SeqFlow, an autoregressive\nnormalizing flow for sequence data. In addition, we develop a new candidate\nsampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the exploration probability for each\ntoken based on its importance.

This study tackles the most difficult subtask when both\ntarget labels and source data are inaccessible, namely, source-free domain\nadaptation. To reuse the classification backbone pre-trained on source data,\ntime series reconstruction is a sound solution that aligns target and source\ntime series by minimizing the reconstruction errors of both. However, simply\nfine-tuning the source pre-trained reconstruction model on target data may lose\nthe learnt priori, and it struggles to accommodate domain varying temporal\npatterns in a single encoder-decoder. Therefore, this paper tries to\ndisentangle the composition of domain transferability by using a compositional\narchitecture for time series reconstruction. Here, the preceding component is a\nU-net frozen since pre-trained, the output of which during adaptation is the\ninitial reconstruction of a given target time series, acting as a coarse step\nto prompt the subsequent finer adaptation. The following pipeline for finer\nadaptation includes two parallel branches: The source replay branch using a\nresidual link to preserve the output of U-net, and the offset compensation\nbranch that applies an additional autoencoder (AE) to further warp U-net's\noutput. By deploying a learnable factor on either branch to scale their\ncomposition in the final output of reconstruction, the data transferability is\ndisentangled and the learnt reconstructive capability from source data is\nretained. During inference, aside from the batch-level optimization in the\ntraining, we search at test time stability-aware rescaling of source replay\nbranch to tolerate instance-wise variation.

Despite recent improvements, small LLMs struggle to handle questions\ninvolving multiple tables and complex SQL patterns under a Zero-Shot Learning\n(ZSL) setting. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) partially compensate the knowledge\ndeficits in pretrained models but falls short while dealing with queries\ninvolving multi-hop reasoning. To bridge this gap, different LLM training\nstrategies to reinforce reasoning capabilities have been proposed, ranging from\nleveraging a thinking process within ZSL, including reasoning traces in SFT, or\nadopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. However, the influence of\nreasoning on Text2SQL performance is still largely unexplored. This paper\ninvestigates to what extent LLM reasoning capabilities influence their Text2SQL\nperformance on four benchmark datasets. To this end, it considers the following\nLLM settings: (1) ZSL, including general-purpose reasoning or not; (2) SFT,\nwith and without task-specific reasoning traces; (3) RL, leveraging execution\naccuracy as primary reward function; (4) SFT+RL, i.e, a two-stage approach that\ncombines SFT and RL. The results show that general-purpose reasoning under ZSL\nproves to be ineffective in tackling complex Text2SQL cases. Small LLMs benefit\nfrom SFT with reasoning much more than larger ones, bridging the gap of their\n(weaker) model pretraining. RL is generally beneficial across all tested models\nand datasets, particularly when SQL queries involve multi-hop reasoning and\nmultiple tables. Small LLMs with SFT+RL excel on most complex datasets thanks\nto a strategic balance between generality of the reasoning process and\noptimization of the execution accuracy.

Recent multi-modal approaches have shown promise in improving FFIA\nrobustness and efficiency. However, these methods face significant challenges\nwhen adapting to new fish species or environments due to catastrophic\nforgetting and the lack of suitable datasets. To address these limitations, we\nfirst introduce AV-CIL-FFIA, a new dataset comprising 81,932 labelled\naudio-visual clips capturing feeding intensities across six different fish\nspecies in real aquaculture environments. Then, we pioneer audio-visual class\nincremental learning (CIL) for FFIA and demonstrate through benchmarking on\nAV-CIL-FFIA that it significantly outperforms single-modality methods. Existing\nCIL methods rely heavily on historical data. Exemplar-based approaches store\nraw samples, creating storage challenges, while exemplar-free methods avoid\ndata storage but struggle to distinguish subtle feeding intensity variations\nacross different fish species. To overcome these limitations, we introduce\nHAIL-FFIA, a novel audio-visual class-incremental learning framework that\nbridges this gap with a prototype-based approach that achieves exemplar-free\nefficiency while preserving essential knowledge through compact feature\nrepresentations. Specifically, HAIL-FFIA employs hierarchical representation\nlearning with a dual-path knowledge preservation mechanism that separates\ngeneral intensity knowledge from fish-specific characteristics. Additionally,\nit features a dynamic modality balancing system that adaptively adjusts the\nimportance of audio versus visual information based on feeding behaviour\nstages.

However, analysts in many real-world settings must often exercise\nfine-grained control over specific analysis steps, verify intermediate results\nexplicitly, and iteratively refine their analytical approaches. Such tasks\npresent barriers to building robust and reproducible analyses using LLMs alone\nor even in conjunction with existing authoring tools (e.g., computational\nnotebooks). This paper introduces Flowco, a new mixed-initiative system to\naddress these challenges. Flowco leverages a visual dataflow programming model\nand integrates LLMs into every phase of the authoring process. A user study\nsuggests that Flowco supports analysts, particularly those with less\nprogramming experience, in quickly authoring, debugging, and refining data\nanalyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "Flowco \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1Flowco\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5c06LLM\u878d\u5165\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eFlowco\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u5feb\u901f\u7f16\u5199\u3001\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662fFlowco\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u521d\u5b66\u8005\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This allows us to cleanly and controllably\nquantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like\nreal-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our\ntasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a)\ndiscovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay,\ndrawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in\ndesigning math problems or new proteins).

However, FL systems have low resource\nutilization limiting their practical use in the real world.

Second, the server\nperforms centralized training using a task scheduler that ensures balanced\ncontributions from all devices, improving model accuracy.

The estimation of CE enables educators to modify material to enhance\nlearning effectiveness and student engagement. Relative neural efficiency (RNE)\nand relative neural involvement (RNI) are two metrics that have been used to\nrepresent CE. To estimate RNE and RNI we need hemodynamic response in the brain\nand the performance score of a task.We collected oxygenated hemoglobin ($\\Delta\n\\mathrm{HbO}$).

The study compares traditional machine learning techniques with deep\nlearning models such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and a hybrid CNN-GRU to determine\nwhich approach provides better accuracy in predicting performance scores. The\nresult shows that the hybrid CNN-GRU gives better performance with 78.36\\%\ntraining accuracy and 73.08\\% test accuracy than other models.

Second, we present a novel method for\nestimating faithfulness that is based on: (1) using an auxiliary LLM to modify\nthe values of concepts within model inputs to create realistic counterfactuals,\nand (2) using a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the causal effects of\nconcepts at both the example- and dataset-level. Our experiments show that our\nmethod can be used to quantify and discover interpretable patterns of\nunfaithfulness. On a social bias task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations\nhide the influence of social bias. On a medical question answering task, we\nuncover cases where LLM explanations provide misleading claims about which\npieces of evidence influenced the model's decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6d4b\u91cfLLM\u89e3\u91ca\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u8bef\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9LLM\u521b\u5efa\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Bayesian\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dLLM\u89e3\u91ca\u9690\u85cf\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4e0d\u5fe0\u8bda\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u91cf\u5316LLM\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

A recent line of work proposes\nan abstract view, called language generation in the limit, where generation is\nseen as a game between an adversary and an algorithm: the adversary generates\nstrings from an unknown language $K$, chosen from a countable collection of\ncandidate languages, and after seeing a finite set of these strings, the\nalgorithm must generate new strings from $K$ that it has not seen before. This\nformalism highlights a key tension: the trade-off between validity (the\nalgorithm should only produce strings from the language) and breadth (it should\nbe able to produce many strings from the language). This trade-off is central\nin applied language generation as well, where it appears as a balance between\nhallucination (generating invalid utterances) and mode collapse (generating\nonly a restricted set of outputs). Despite its importance, this trade-off has\nbeen challenging to study quantitatively. We develop ways to quantify this\ntrade-off by formalizing breadth using measures of density. Existing algorithms\nfor language generation in the limit produce output sets that can have zero\ndensity in the true language, and this important failure of breadth might seem\nunavoidable. We show, however, that such a failure is not necessary: we provide\nan algorithm for language generation in the limit whose outputs have strictly\npositive density in $K$. We also study the internal representations built by\nthese algorithms, specifically the sequence of hypothesized candidate languages\nthey consider, and show that achieving the strongest form of breadth may\nrequire oscillating indefinitely between high- and low-density representations.\nOur analysis introduces a novel topology on language families, with notions of\nconvergence and limit points playing a key role.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper formalizes the trade-off between validity and breadth in language generation, proposes an algorithm with positive density outputs, and introduces a novel topology.", "motivation": "To quantify the trade-off between hallucination and mode collapse in large language models, which has been challenging to study.", "method": "Formalizing breadth using density measures, developing an algorithm for language generation in the limit, and analyzing representations with a novel topology on language families.", "result": "An algorithm that achieves strictly positive density in the true language, and strong breadth may require oscillating between representations.", "conclusion": "Poor breadth is not necessary, and topological concepts are key to understanding language generation algorithms."}}

Among various approaches, robust visual tracking\nthat combines RGB frames with Event streams has attracted increasing attention\nfrom researchers. While striving for high accuracy and efficiency in tracking,\nit is also important to explore how to effectively conduct adversarial attacks\nand defenses on RGB-Event stream tracking algorithms, yet research in this area\nremains relatively scarce. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a\ncross-modal adversarial attack algorithm for RGB-Event visual tracking. Because\nof the diverse representations of Event streams, and given that Event voxels\nand frames are more commonly used, this paper will focus on these two\nrepresentations for an in-depth study. Specifically, for the RGB-Event voxel,\nwe first optimize the perturbation by adversarial loss to generate RGB frame\nadversarial examples. For discrete Event voxel representations, we propose a\ntwo-step attack strategy, more in detail, we first inject Event voxels into the\ntarget region as initialized adversarial examples, then, conduct a\ngradient-guided optimization by perturbing the spatial location of the Event\nvoxels. For the RGB-Event frame based tracking, we optimize the cross-modal\nuniversal perturbation by integrating the gradient information from multimodal\ndata. We evaluate the proposed approach against attacks on three widely used\nRGB-Event Tracking datasets, i.e., COESOT, FE108, and VisEvent.

Recently, many methods based on the\n3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework have been proposed to address\nsparse-view 3D reconstruction. Although these methods have made considerable\nadvancements, they still show significant issues with overfitting. To reduce\nthe overfitting, we introduce VGNC, a novel Validation-guided Gaussian Number\nControl (VGNC) approach based on generative novel view synthesis (NVS) models.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to alleviate the\noverfitting issue of sparse-view 3DGS with generative validation images.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a validation image generation method based on\na generative NVS model. We then propose a Gaussian number control strategy that\nutilizes generated validation images to determine the optimal Gaussian numbers,\nthereby reducing the issue of overfitting. We conducted detailed experiments on\nvarious sparse-view 3DGS baselines and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness\nof VGNC.

Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) that empower robots with semantic reflection ability for failure,\ntranslating semantic reflection into how to correct fine-grained robotic\nactions remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we build the\nPhoenix framework, which leverages motion instruction as a bridge to connect\nhigh-level semantic reflection with low-level robotic action correction. In\nthis motion-based self-reflection framework, we start with a dual-process\nmotion adjustment mechanism with MLLMs to translate the semantic reflection\ninto coarse-grained motion instruction adjustment. To leverage this motion\ninstruction for guiding how to correct fine-grained robotic actions, a\nmulti-task motion-conditioned diffusion policy is proposed to integrate visual\nobservations for high-frequency robotic action correction. By combining these\ntwo models, we could shift the demand for generalization capability from the\nlow-level manipulation policy to the MLLMs-driven motion adjustment model and\nfacilitate precise, fine-grained robotic action correction. Utilizing this\nframework, we further develop a lifelong learning method to automatically\nimprove the model's capability from interactions with dynamic environments.

However, systematic evaluations of RSF tunability remain\nlimited, especially in predictive maintenance contexts. We introduce a\nthree-level framework to quantify tunability: (1) a model-level metric\nmeasuring overall performance gain from tuning, (2) a hyperparameter-level\nmetric assessing individual contributions, and (3) identification of optimal\ntuning ranges. These metrics are evaluated across multiple datasets using\nsurvival-specific criteria: the C-index for discrimination and the Brier score\nfor calibration. Experiments on four CMAPSS dataset subsets, simulating\naircraft engine degradation, reveal that hyperparameter tuning consistently\nimproves model performance. On average, the C-index increased by 0.0547, while\nthe Brier score decreased by 0.0199. These gains were consistent across all\nsubsets. Moreover, ntree and mtry showed the highest average tunability, while\nnodesize offered stable improvements within the range of 10 to 30.

Building on these breakthroughs, code LLMs with\nadvanced coding capabilities bring huge impacts on software engineering,\nshowing the tendency to become an essential part of developers' daily routines.\nHowever, the current code LLMs still face serious challenges related to\ntrustworthiness, as they can generate incorrect, insecure, or unreliable code.\nRecent exploratory studies find that it can be promising to detect such risky\noutputs by analyzing LLMs' internal states, akin to how the human brain\nunconsciously recognizes its own mistakes. Yet, most of these approaches are\nlimited to narrow sub-domains of LLM operations and fall short of achieving\nindustry-level scalability and practicability.

The core idea is that the\nrisk assessment framework could also undergo a pre-training process similar to\nLLMs. Specifically, PtTrust first performs unsupervised pre-training on\nlarge-scale unlabeled source code to learn general representations of LLM\nstates. Then, it uses a small, labeled dataset to train a risk predictor. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PtTrust through fine-grained, code line-level\nrisk assessment and demonstrate that it generalizes across tasks and different\nprogramming languages.

However, in many practical scenarios such as medical\nimaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward\nand usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often\nintroduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and\ninconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in\nprocurement time can lead to misaligned ground truth annotations. These label\nerrors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in\nspatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the\nsame errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian\nestimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data includes\nlabel errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial\ncorrelations between adjacent pixels. Bayesian inference requires computing the\nposterior distribution of label errors, which becomes intractable when spatial\ncorrelations are present. We represent the correlation of label errors between\nadjacent pixels through a Gaussian distribution whose covariance is structured\nby a Kac-Murdock-Szeg\\\"{o} (KMS) matrix, solving the computational challenges.\nThrough experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging\nthe spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance.\nNotably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method\nachieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate\nnoise levels.

In this study, we investigated the\npotential of multimodal data to improve model performance in diagnosing 78\nsecondary school students' CPS subskills and indicators in authentic\neducational settings. In particular, text embeddings from verbal data and\nacoustic embeddings from audio data were used in a multimodal classification\nmodel for CPS diagnosis. Both unimodal and multimodal transformer-based models\noutperformed traditional models in detecting CPS classes. Although the\ninclusion of multimodality did not improve the performance of traditional\nunimodal models, its integration into transformer-based models demonstrated\nimproved performance for diagnosing social-cognitive CPS classes compared to\nunimodal transformer-based models.

Contrastive learning presents a potential but still\nproblematic solution to this issue. Because most existing methods focus on\nextracting instance-level or pixel-to-pixel representation, which ignores the\ncharacteristics between intra-image similar pixel groups. Moreover, when\nconsidering contrastive pairs generation, most SOTA methods mainly rely on\nmanually setting thresholds, which requires a large number of gradient\nexperiments and lacks efficiency and generalization. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel contrastive learning approach named SuperCL for medical\nimage segmentation pre-training. Specifically, our SuperCL exploits the\nstructural prior and pixel correlation of images by introducing two novel\ncontrastive pairs generation strategies: Intra-image Local Contrastive Pairs\n(ILCP) Generation and Inter-image Global Contrastive Pairs (IGCP) Generation.\nConsidering superpixel cluster aligns well with the concept of contrastive\npairs generation, we utilize the superpixel map to generate pseudo masks for\nboth ILCP and IGCP to guide supervised contrastive learning. Moreover, we also\npropose two modules named Average SuperPixel Feature Map Generation (ASP) and\nConnected Components Label Generation (CCL) to better exploit the prior\nstructural information for IGCP. Finally, experiments on 8 medical image\ndatasets indicate our SuperCL outperforms existing 12 methods. i.e. Our SuperCL\nachieves a superior performance with more precise predictions from\nvisualization figures and 3.15%, 5.44%, 7.89% DSC higher than the previous best\nresults on MMWHS, CHAOS, Spleen with 10% annotations.

Quadrotors operating in real-world\nenvironments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large\namount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for\nreal-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and\nnoisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying\nlearning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention\nthe infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which\nmakes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment,\nflight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and\nhardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables\nquadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in\nseveral minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including\nhovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and\nplanning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark.

For\nevaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20\ndifferent reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP\nscore, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare\ninstance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple\nFAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an\n81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets\nindeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an\nappropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality\nwin rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON\nexhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for\nimproving human-perceived quality.

However, ToT was not approached in a fully Bayesian\nfashion, a flaw that makes it susceptible to stability problems. To address\nthis issue, we propose a fully Bayesian Topics over Time (BToT) model via the\nintroduction of a conjugate prior to the Beta distribution. This prior acts as\na regularization that prevents the online version of the algorithm from\nunstable updates when a topic is poorly represented in a mini-batch. The\ncharacteristics of this prior to the Beta distribution are studied here for the\nfirst time. Still, this model suffers from a difference in scale between the\nsingle-time observations and the multiplicity of words per document. A\nvariation of BToT, Weighted Bayesian Topics over Time (WBToT), is proposed as a\nsolution. In WBToT, publication dates are repeated a certain number of times\nper document, which balances the relative influence of words and timestamps\nalong the inference process. We have tested our models on two datasets: a\ncollection of over 200 years of US state-of-the-union (SOTU) addresses and a\nlarge-scale COVID-19 Twitter corpus of 10 million tweets. The results show that\nWBToT captures events better than Latent Dirichlet Allocation and other SOTA\ntopic models like BERTopic: the median absolute deviation of the topic presence\nover time is reduced by $51\\%$ and $34\\%$, respectively. Our experiments also\ndemonstrate the superior coherence of WBToT over BToT, which highlights the\nimportance of balancing the time and word modalities.

Specifically, most video\nadversarial training methods are computationally costly, with long training\ntimes and high expenses. Second, existing methods struggle with the trade-off\nbetween clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency\n(VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data.\nSpecifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it\nintegrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation\n(TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a\nsingle-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness.

Training large-scale AI models now requires vast\ninterconnected GPU clusters across multiple data centers. Multi-scale AI\ntraining and inference demand uniform, ultra-low latency, and energy-efficient\nlinks to enable massive GPUs to function as a single cohesive unit. However,\ntraditional electrical and optical interconnects, relying on conventional\ndigital signal processors (DSPs) for signal distortion compensation,\nincreasingly fail to meet these stringent requirements. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present an integrated neuromorphic optical signal processor\n(OSP) that leverages deep reservoir computing and achieves DSP-free,\nall-optical, real-time processing. Experimentally, our OSP achieves a 100 Gbaud\nPAM4 per lane, 1.6 Tbit/s data center interconnect over a 5 km optical fiber in\nthe C-band (equivalent to over 80 km in the O-band), far exceeding the reach of\nstate-of-the-art DSP solutions, which are fundamentally constrained by\nchromatic dispersion in IMDD systems. Simultaneously, it reduces processing\nlatency by four orders of magnitude and energy consumption by three orders of\nmagnitude. Unlike DSPs, which introduce increased latency at high data rates,\nour OSP maintains consistent, ultra-low latency regardless of data rate\nscaling, making it ideal for future optical interconnects.

We propose\nC2RUST-BENCH that contains 2,905 functions, which are representative of\nC-to-Rust transpilation, selected from 15,503 functions of real-world programs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faC2RUST-BENCH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30C\u5230Rust\u8f6c\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5185\u5b58\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8017\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u91cfC\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b2905\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684C2RUST-BENCH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece15503\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30C\u5230Rust\u8f6c\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
